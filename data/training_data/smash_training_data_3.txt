@noneinterestin rip
@noneinterestin I mean that's fine, I'm just saying that a lot of people just walk off without disconnecting entirely (they don't know how to or jusy forget) and this makes it simpler if they aren't on the set anymore or if they want to disconnect during a game or smth
@thekylemcclusky I lost my switch a while ago, I've been lacking updates lol
Act 2 of my DDLC run is out!

You're gonna hate it!
