How tf are there people still thinking that yo-yo is OP
It's not when:
-It doesn't completely negate the whole roster's recoveries
-The charging hitbox's rehits/multihits is so inconsistent no matter how u timed it
-The yoyo has projectile properties, so it easily gets beaten out

When I watched Living With Yourself
I cannot unsee myself as Miles &amp; clone Miles is someone who I yearn to be just like Miles

If it means I'll also get jealous &amp; hate "myself" cause everyone loves him &amp; does things better than I do, yes lmao https://t.co/zUTz6tWlLG
Yeah, all of them except Living With Yourself are zombie films lmao
@64mchl I'll be back for sure ðŸ˜„

Also come to my going away party
@toph_bbq @boba_ck Your "OH!" Reminds me of my reaction to @ViciousVish unveiling his shirt lmao https://t.co/N6rTOpMSll
@bambi_YL @I_AM_DJANGOFETT Haha really? Also it was dope playing you and interacting at Smashcon. Even though I was "scared" and all that shit ðŸ™„
@I_AM_DJANGOFETT I went to 2 NY locals tho if that changes anything, cuz they were convenient or not like, out for my head and shit.

So you can keep thinking I'm like scared or whatever lol.
@I_AM_DJANGOFETT LOL I actually didn't attend many locals in Socal outside of ones that were within 30 minutes, as opposed to the NJ locals that'd take me an hour to get to.

And tbh, a lot of local top players would speak of how shitty the local attitude can be, so this reinforces it lmao
