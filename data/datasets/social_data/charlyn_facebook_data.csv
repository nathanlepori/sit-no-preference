"The game is called ""a reunion of friends"". The idea is to see who reads a post when it does not include a photograph. If no one reads my wall, this should be a short experiment, but if you are reading this message, make a comment using a single word about how we met. Just a word, please, for example, a place, the name of the person who introduced us, etc. The game is to do it with *ONE WORD*. Then, copy this message on your wall and I will also leave you a word.
Please, don't leave a word and then not bother copying...you will spoil the fun. ð",2016-10-16 21:12:42
