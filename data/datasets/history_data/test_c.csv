Python: Get relative path from comparing two absolute paths

Say, I have two absolute paths. I need to check if the location referring to by one of the paths is a descendant of the other. If true, I need to find out the relative path of the descendant from the ancestor. What's a good way to implement this in Python? Any library that I can benefit from?

os.path.commonprefix()  and  os.path.relpath()  are your friends:
>>> print os.path.commonprefix(['/usr/var/log', '/usr/var/security'])
'/usr/var'
>>> print os.path.commonprefix(['/tmp', '/usr/var'])  # No common prefix: the root is the common prefix
'/'
You can thus test whether the common prefix is one of the paths, i.e. if one of the paths is a common ancestor:
paths = […, …, …]
common_prefix = os.path.commonprefix(list_of_paths)
if common_prefix in paths:
…
You can then find the relative paths:
relative_paths = [os.path.relpath(path, common_prefix) for path in paths]
You can even handle more than two paths, with this method, and test whether all the paths are all below one of them.
PS : depending on how your paths look like, you might want to perform some normalization first (this is useful in situations where one does not know whether they always end with '/' or not, or if some of the paths are relative).  Relevant functions include  os.path.abspath()  and  os.path.normpath() .
PPS : as Peter Briggs mentioned in the comments, the simple approach described above can fail:
>>> os.path.commonprefix(['/usr/var', '/usr/var2/log'])
'/usr/var'
even though  /usr/var  is  not  a common prefix of the paths.  Forcing all paths to end with '/' before calling  commonprefix()  solves this (specific) problem.
PPPS : as bluenote10 mentioned, adding a slash does not solve the general problem. Here is his followup question:  How to circumvent the fallacy of Python's os.path.commonprefix?
PPPPS : starting with Python 3.4, we have  pathlib , a module that provides a saner path manipulation environment. I guess that the common prefix of a set of paths can be obtained by getting all the prefixes of each path (with  PurePath.parents() ), taking the intersection of all these parent sets, and selecting the longest common prefix.
PPPPPS : Python 3.5 introduced a proper solution to this question:  os.path.commonpath() , which returns a valid path.

Take care with  commonprefix , as e.g. the common prefix for  /usr/var/log  and  /usr/var2/log  is returned as  /usr/var  - which is probably not what you'd expect. (It's also possible for it to return paths that are not valid directories.)

@EOL: I don't really see how to fix the problem by appending a slash :(. What if we have  ['/usr/var1/log/', '/usr/var2/log/'] ?

os.path.relpath :
Return a relative filepath to path either from the current directory or from an optional start point.
>>> from os.path import relpath
>>> relpath('/usr/var/log/', '/usr/var')
'log'
>>> relpath('/usr/var/log/', '/usr/var/sad/')
'../log'
So, if relative path starts with  '..'  - it means that the second path is not descendant of the first path.
In Python3 you can use  PurePath.relative_to :
Python 3.5.1 (default, Jan 22 2016, 08:54:32)
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> Path('/usr/var/log').relative_to('/usr/var/log/')
PosixPath('.')
>>> Path('/usr/var/log').relative_to('/usr/var/')
PosixPath('log')
>>> Path('/usr/var/log').relative_to('/etc/')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
File ""/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.5.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/pathlib.py"", line 851, in relative_to
.format(str(self), str(formatted)))
ValueError: '/usr/var/log' does not start with '/etc'

Checking for the presence of  os.pardir  is more robust than checking for  ..  (agreed, there are not many other conventions, though).

Am I wrong or is  os.relpath  more powerful since it handles  ..  and  PurePath.relative_to()  does not?   Am I missing something?

Another option is

This always return a relative path; this does not directly indicate whether one of the paths is above the other (one can check for the presence of  os.pardir  in front of the two possible resulting relative paths, though).

A write-up of jme's suggestion, using pathlib, in Python 3.
from pathlib import Path
parent = Path(r'/a/b')
son = Path(r'/a/b/c/d')
​
if parent in son.parents:
print(son.relative_to(parent)) # returns Path object equivalent to 'c/d'

Pure Python2 w/o dep:
def relpath(cwd, path):
""""""Create a relative path for path from cwd, if possible""""""
if sys.platform == ""win32"":
cwd = cwd.lower()
path = path.lower()
_cwd = os.path.abspath(cwd).split(os.path.sep)
_path = os.path.abspath(path).split(os.path.sep)

This one looks good, but, as I stumble upon, there is an issue when  cwd  and  path  are the same. it should check first if those two are the same and return either  """"  or  "".""

Edit :  See jme's answer for the best way with Python3.
Using pathlib, you have the following solution :
Let's say we want to check if  son  is a descendant of  parent , and both are  Path  objects.
We can get a list of the  parts  in the path with  list(parent.parts) .
Then, we just check that the begining of the son is equal to the list of segments of the parent.
>>> lparent = list(parent.parts)
>>> lson = list(son.parts)
>>> if lson[:len(lparent)] == lparent:
>>> ... #parent is a parent of son :)
If you want to get the remaining part, you can just do
>>> ''.join(lson[len(lparent):])
It's a string, but you can of course use it as a constructor of an other Path object.

It's even easier than that: simply  parent in son.parents , and if it is, getting the remainder with  son.relative_to(parent) .

Python: split a list based on a condition?

What's the best way, both aesthetically and from a performance perspective, to split a list of items into multiple lists based on a conditional? The equivalent of:
good = [x for x in mylist if x in goodvals]
bad  = [x for x in mylist if x not in goodvals]
is there a more elegant way to do this?
Update: here's the actual use case, to better explain what I'm trying to do:
# files looks like: [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi'), ... ]
IMAGE_TYPES = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
images = [f for f in files if f[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES]
anims  = [f for f in files if f[2].lower() not in IMAGE_TYPES]

split  is an unfortunate description of this operation, since it already has a specific meaning with respect to Python strings. I think  divide  is a more precise (or at least less overloaded in the context of Python iterables) word to describe this operation. I landed here looking for a list equivalent of  str.split() , to  split  the list into an ordered collection of consecutive sub-lists. E.g.  split([1,2,3,4,5,3,6], 3) -> ([1,2],[4,5],[6]) , as opposed to  dividing  a list's elements by category.

IMAGE_TYPES should be a set instead of a tuple:  IMAGE_TYPES = set('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png') . n(1) instead of n(o/2), with practically no difference in readability.

good = [x for x in mylist if x in goodvals]
bad  = [x for x in mylist if x not in goodvals]
is there a more elegant way to do this?
That code is perfectly readable, and extremely clear!
# files looks like: [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi'), ... ]
IMAGE_TYPES = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
images = [f for f in files if f[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES]
anims  = [f for f in files if f[2].lower() not in IMAGE_TYPES]
Again, this is  fine!
There might be slight performance improvements using sets, but it's a trivial difference, and I find the list comprehension far easier to read, and you don't have to worry about the order being messed up, duplicates being removed as so on.
In fact, I may go another step ""backward"", and just use a simple for loop:
images, anims = [], []
for f in files:
if f.lower() in IMAGE_TYPES:
images.append(f)
else:
anims.append(f)
The a list-comprehension or using  set()  is fine until you need to add some other check or another bit of logic - say you want to remove all 0-byte jpeg's, you just add something like..
if f[1] == 0:
continue

Once the appetite for functional programming (Haskell), or functional style (LINQ) is raised, we start to smell Python for its age -  [x for x in blah if ...]  - verbose,  lambda  is clumsy and limited... It feels like driving the coolest car from 1995 today. Not the same as back then.
–  Tomasz Gandor

@TomaszGandor FTR, Haskell is  older  than Python (and actually influenced its design). I think the syntax for list comprehension and lambdas was deliberately kept a bit on the verbose side, perhaps to discourage over-using them. Which is indeed a bit of a risk... as much as I like Haskell, I can see why many people find Python generally more readable.

@dansalmo Especially since you can make it a one-liner with the for-cycle, and if you wanted to append something more complicated than  x , you can make it into one  append  only:  for x in mylist: (good if isgood(x) else bad).append(x)

Here's the lazy iterator approach:
from itertools import tee
def split_on_condition(seq, condition):
l1, l2 = tee((condition(item), item) for item in seq)
return (i for p, i in l1 if p), (i for p, i in l2 if not p)
It evaluates the condition once per item and returns two generators, first yielding values from the sequence where the condition is true, the other where it's false.
Because it's lazy you can use it on any iterator, even an infinite one:
from itertools import count, islice
def is_prime(n):
return n > 1 and all(n % i for i in xrange(2, n))
primes, not_primes = split_on_condition(count(), is_prime)
print(""First 10 primes"", list(islice(primes, 10)))
print(""First 10 non-primes"", list(islice(not_primes, 10)))
Usually though the non-lazy list returning approach is better:
def split_on_condition(seq, condition):
a, b = [], []
for item in seq:
(a if condition(item) else b).append(item)
return a, b
Edit: For your more specific usecase of splitting items into different lists by some key, heres a generic function that does that:
DROP_VALUE = lambda _:_
def split_by_key(seq, resultmapping, keyfunc, default=DROP_VALUE):
""""""Split a sequence into lists based on a key function.
seq - input sequence
resultmapping - a dictionary that maps from target lists to keys that go to that list
keyfunc - function to calculate the key of an input value
default - the target where items that don't have a corresponding key go, by default they are dropped
""""""
result_lists = dict((key, []) for key in resultmapping)
appenders = dict((key, result_lists[target].append) for target, keys in resultmapping.items() for key in keys)
if default is not DROP_VALUE:
result_lists.setdefault(default, [])
default_action = result_lists[default].append
else:
default_action = DROP_VALUE
for item in seq:
appenders.get(keyfunc(item), default_action)(item)
return result_lists
Usage:
def file_extension(f):
return f[2].lower()
split_files = split_by_key(files, {'images': IMAGE_TYPES}, keyfunc=file_extension, default='anims')
print split_files['images']
print split_files['anims']

+1 for offering multiple variations including iterator-based and a specific ""in X"" solution. The OP's ""in goodvals"" might be small, but replacing this with a very large dictionary or expensive predicate could be expensive. Also it reduces the need to write the list comprehension twice  everywhere  it's needed, thus reducing the likelihood for introducing typos/user error. Nice solution. Thanks!

Note that  tee  stores all the values between the iterators it returns, so it won't really save memory if you loop over one entire generator and then the other.

Problem with all proposed solutions is that it will scan and apply the filtering function twice. I'd make a simple small function like this:
def SplitIntoTwoLists(l, f):
a = []
b = []
for i in l:
if f(i):
a.append(i)
else:
b.append(i)
return (a,b)
That way you are not processing anything twice and also are not repeating code.

I agree. I was looking for an ""elegant"" (i.e. here meaning short and built-in/implicit) way to do this without scanning the list twice, but this seems (without profiling) to be the way to go. Of course it would only matter anyway for large amounts of data.

My take on it. I propose a lazy, single-pass,  partition  function,
which preserves relative order in the output subsequences.
1. Requirements
I assume that the requirements are:
maintain elements' relative order (hence, no sets and
dictionaries)
evaluate condition only once for every element (hence not using
( i ) filter  or  groupby )
allow for lazy consumption of either sequence (if we can afford to
precompute them, then the naïve implementation is likely to be
acceptable too)
2.  split  library
My  partition  function (introduced below) and other similar functions
have made it into a small library:
python-split
It's installable normally via PyPI:
pip install --user split
To split a list base on condition, use  partition  function:
>>> from split import partition
>>> files = [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi') ]
>>> image_types = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
>>> images, other = partition(lambda f: f[-1] in image_types, files)
>>> list(images)
[('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg')]
>>> list(other)
[('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi')]
3.  partition  function explained
Internally we need to build two subsequences at once, so consuming
only one output sequence will force the other one to be computed
too. And we need to keep state between user requests (store processed
but not yet requested elements). To keep state, I use two double-ended
queues ( deques ):
from collections import deque
SplitSeq  class takes care of the housekeeping:
class SplitSeq:
def __init__(self, condition, sequence):
self.cond = condition
self.goods = deque([])
self.bads = deque([])
self.seq = iter(sequence)
Magic happens in its  .getNext()  method. It is almost like  .next()
of the iterators, but allows to specify which kind of element we want
this time. Behind the scene it doesn't discard the rejected elements,
but instead puts them in one of the two queues:
def getNext(self, getGood=True):
if getGood:
these, those, cond = self.goods, self.bads, self.cond
else:
these, those, cond = self.bads, self.goods, lambda x: not self.cond(x)
if these:
return these.popleft()
else:
while 1: # exit on StopIteration
n = self.seq.next()
if cond(n):
return n
else:
those.append(n)
The end user is supposed to use  partition  function. It takes a
condition function and a sequence (just like  map  or  filter ), and
returns two generators. The first generator builds a subsequence of
elements for which the condition holds, the second one builds the
complementary subsequence. Iterators and generators allow for lazy
splitting of even long or infinite sequences.
def partition(condition, sequence):
cond = condition if condition else bool  # evaluate as bool if condition == None
ss = SplitSeq(cond, sequence)
def goods():
while 1:
yield ss.getNext(getGood=True)
def bads():
while 1:
yield ss.getNext(getGood=False)
return goods(), bads()
I chose the test function to be the first argument to facilitate
partial application in the future (similar to how  map  and  filter
have the test function as the first argument).

First go  (pre-OP-edit): Use sets:
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
goodvals = [1,3,7,8,9]
myset = set(mylist)
goodset = set(goodvals)
print list(myset.intersection(goodset))  # [1, 3, 7]
print list(myset.difference(goodset))    # [2, 4, 5, 6]
That's good for both readability (IMHO) and performance.
Second go  (post-OP-edit):
Create your list of good extensions as a set:
IMAGE_TYPES = set(['.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png'])
and that will increase performance.  Otherwise, what you have looks fine to me.

Creating a set is O(n log n).  Iterating the list twice is O(n).  The set solution may be more elegant (when it's correct in the first place) but is most certainly slower as n increases.

I basically like Anders' approach as it is very general.  Here's a version that puts the categorizer first (to match filter syntax) and uses a defaultdict (assumed imported).
def categorize(func, seq):
""""""Return mapping from categories to lists
of categorized items.
""""""
d = defaultdict(list)
for item in seq:
d[func(item)].append(item)
return d

itertools.groupby  almost does what you want, except it requires the items to be sorted to ensure that you get a single contiguous range, so you need to sort by your key first (otherwise you'll get multiple interleaved groups for each type).  eg.
def is_good(f):
return f[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES
files = [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi'), ('file3.gif', 123L, '.gif')]
for key, group in itertools.groupby(sorted(files, key=is_good), key=is_good):
print key, list(group)
gives:
False [('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi')]
True [('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file3.gif', 123L, '.gif')]
Similar to the other solutions, the key func can be defined to divide into any number of groups you want.

Personally, I like the version you cited, assuming you already have a list of  goodvals  hanging around.  If not, something like:
good = filter(lambda x: is_good(x), mylist)
bad = filter(lambda x: not is_good(x), mylist)
Of course, that's really very similar to using a list comprehension like you originally did, but with a function instead of a lookup:
good = [x for x in mylist if is_good(x)]
bad  = [x for x in mylist if not is_good(x)]
In general, I find the aesthetics of list comprehensions to be very pleasing.  Of course, if you don't actually need to preserve ordering and don't need duplicates, using the  intersection  and  difference  methods on sets would work well too.

If you want to make it in FP style:
good, bad = [ sum(x, []) for x in zip(*(([y], []) if y in goodvals else ([], [y])
for y in mylist)) ]
Not the most readable solution, but at least iterates through mylist only once.

Although it iterates through the list only once, the performance is not that good because of the list appends. Appending to a list is potentially expensive operation (when compared with deque.append for example). Actually, this solution is extremely slow when compared with other solutions in here (21.4s on 100000 random integers and testing their value).

I think a generalization of splitting a an iterable based on N conditions is handy
from collections import OrderedDict
def partition(iterable,*conditions):
'''Returns a list with the elements that satisfy each of condition.
Conditions are assumed to be exclusive'''
d= OrderedDict((i,list())for i in range(len(conditions)))
for e in iterable:
for i,condition in enumerate(conditions):
if condition(e):
d[i].append(e)
break
return d.values()
For instance:
ints,floats,other = partition([2, 3.14, 1, 1.69, [], None],
lambda x: isinstance(x, int),
lambda x: isinstance(x, float),
lambda x: True)
print "" ints: {}\n floats:{}\n other:{}"".format(ints,floats,other)
ints: [2, 1]
floats:[3.14, 1.69]
other:[[], None]
If the element may satisfy multiple conditions, remove the break.

Sometimes, it looks like list comprehension is not the best thing to use !
I made a little test based on the answer people gave to this topic, tested on a random generated list. Here is the generation of the list (there's probably a better way to do, but it's not the point) :
good_list = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
import random
import string
my_origin_list = []
for i in xrange(10000):
fname = ''.join(random.choice(string.lowercase) for i in range(random.randrange(10)))
if random.getrandbits(1):
fext = random.choice(good_list)
else:
fext = ""."" + ''.join(random.choice(string.lowercase) for i in range(3))
my_origin_list.append((fname + fext, random.randrange(1000), fext))
And here we go
# Parand
def f1():
return [e for e in my_origin_list if e[2] in good_list], [e for e in my_origin_list if not e[2] in good_list]
# dbr
def f2():
a, b = list(), list()
for e in my_origin_list:
if e[2] in good_list:
a.append(e)
else:
b.append(e)
return a, b
# John La Rooy
def f3():
a, b = list(), list()
for e in my_origin_list:
(b, a)[e[2] in good_list].append(e)
return a, b
# Ants Aasma
def f4():
l1, l2 = tee((e[2] in good_list, e) for e in my_origin_list)
return [i for p, i in l1 if p], [i for p, i in l2 if not p]
# My personal way to do
def f5():
a, b = zip(*[(e, None) if e[2] in good_list else (None, e) for e in my_origin_list])
return list(filter(None, a)), list(filter(None, b))
# BJ Homer
def f6():
return filter(lambda e: e[2] in good_list, my_origin_list), filter(lambda e: not e[2] in good_list, my_origin_list)
Using the  cmpthese  function, the best result is the dbr answer :
f1     204/s  --    -5%   -14%   -15%   -20%   -26%
f6     215/s     6%  --    -9%   -11%   -16%   -22%
f3     237/s    16%    10%  --    -2%    -7%   -14%

Yet another solution to this problem. I needed a solution that is as fast as possible. That means only one iteration over the list and preferably O(1) for adding data to one of the resulting lists. This is very similar to the solution provided by  sastanin , except much shorter:
from collections import deque
def split(iterable, function):
dq_true = deque()
dq_false = deque()
# deque - the fastest way to consume an iterator and append items
deque((
(dq_true if function(item) else dq_false).append(item) for item in iterable
), maxlen=0)
return dq_true, dq_false
Then, you can use the function in the following way:
lower, higher = split([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], lambda x: x < 5)
selected, other = split([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], lambda x: x in {0,4,9})
If you're not fine with the resulting  deque  object, you can easily convert it to  list ,  set , whatever you like (for example  list(lower) ). The conversion is much faster, that construction of the lists directly.
This methods keeps order of the items, as well as any duplicates.

For perfomance, try  itertools .
The  itertools  module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
See  itertools.ifilter  or imap.
itertools.ifilter(predicate, iterable)
Make an iterator that filters elements from iterable returning only those for which the predicate is True

ifilter/imap (and generators in general) are pretty slow... in general, in my profiling, if you take a list comprehension like  [x for x in a if x > 50000]  on a simple array of 100000 integers (via random.shuffle),  filter(lambda x: x> 50000, a)  will take 2x as long,  ifilter(lambda x: x> 50000, a); list(result)  takes about 2.3x as long. Strange but true.

Sometimes you won't need that other half of the list.
For example:
import sys
from itertools import ifilter
trustedPeople = sys.argv[1].split(',')
newName = sys.argv[2]
myFriends = ifilter(lambda x: x.startswith('Shi'), trustedPeople)
print '%s is %smy friend.' % (newName, newName not in myFriends 'not ' or '')

For example, splitting list by even and odd
arr = range(20)
even, odd = reduce(lambda res, next: res[next % 2].append(next) or res, arr, ([], []))
Or in general:
def split(predicate, iterable):
return reduce(lambda res, e: res[predicate(e)].append(e) or res, iterable, ([], []))
Advantages:
Shortest posible way
Predicate applies only once for each element
Disadvantages
Requires knowledge of functional programing paradigm

Inspired by @gnibbler's  great (but terse!) answer , we can apply that approach to map to multiple partitions:
from collections import defaultdict
def splitter(l, mapper):
""""""Split an iterable into multiple partitions generated by a callable mapper.""""""
results = defaultdict(list)
for x in l:
results[mapper(x)] += [x]
return results
Then  splitter  can then be used as follows:
>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 3]
>>> split = splitter(l, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)  # partition l into odds and evens
>>> split.items()
>>> [(False, [1, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3]), (True, [2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 4, 2])]
This works for more than two partitions with a more complicated mapping (and on iterators, too):
>>> import math
>>> l = xrange(1, 23)
>>> split = splitter(l, lambda x: int(math.log10(x) * 5))
>>> split.items()
[(0, [1]),
(1, [2]),
(2, [3]),
(3, [4, 5, 6]),
(4, [7, 8, 9]),
(5, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]),
(6, [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22])]
Or using a dictionary to map:
>>> map = {'A': 1, 'X': 2, 'B': 3, 'Y': 1, 'C': 2, 'Z': 3}
>>> l = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'A', 'Z']
>>> split = splitter(l, map.get)
>>> split.items()
(1, ['A', 'Y', 'A']), (2, ['C', 'C', 'X']), (3, ['B', 'Z', 'Z'])]

The ""d or {}"" is a bit dangerous.  If an empty dict gets passed in, it won't be mutated in place.

True, but it gets returned, so... Actually, this is the perfect example of why you  don't  want to add more clever to your code. :-P

Already quite a few solutions here, but yet another way of doing that would be -
anims = []
images = [f for f in files if (lambda t: True if f[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES else anims.append(t) and False)(f)]
Iterates over the list only once, and looks a bit more pythonic and hence readable to me.
>>> files = [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi'), ('file1.bmp', 33L, '.bmp')]
>>> IMAGE_TYPES = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
>>> anims = []
>>> images = [f for f in files if (lambda t: True if f[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES else anims.append(t) and False)(f)]
>>> print '\n'.join([str(anims), str(images)])
[('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi')]
[('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file1.bmp', 33L, '.bmp')]
>>>

I'd take a 2-pass approach, separating evaluation of the predicate from filtering the list:
def partition(pred, iterable):
xs = list(zip(map(pred, iterable), iterable))
return [x[1] for x in xs if x[0]], [x[1] for x in xs if not x[0]]
What's nice about this, performance-wise (in addition to evaluating  pred  only once on each member of  iterable ), is that it moves a lot of logic out of the interpreter and into highly-optimized iteration and mapping code. This can speed up iteration over long iterables, as described  in this answer .
Expressivity-wise, it takes advantage of expressive idioms like comprehensions and mapping.

If you don't mind using an external library there two I know that nativly implement this operation:
>>> files = [ ('file1.jpg', 33, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999, '.avi')]
>>> IMAGE_TYPES = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
iteration_utilities.partition :
>>> from iteration_utilities import partition
>>> notimages, images = partition(files, lambda x: x[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES)
>>> notimages
[('file2.avi', 999, '.avi')]
>>> images
[('file1.jpg', 33, '.jpg')]
more_itertools.partition
>>> from more_itertools import partition
>>> notimages, images = partition(lambda x: x[2].lower() in IMAGE_TYPES, files)
>>> list(notimages)  # returns a generator so you need to explicitly convert to list.
[('file2.avi', 999, '.avi')]
>>> list(images)
[('file1.jpg', 33, '.jpg')]

Not sure if this is a good approach but it can be done in this way as well
IMAGE_TYPES = ('.jpg','.jpeg','.gif','.bmp','.png')
files = [ ('file1.jpg', 33L, '.jpg'), ('file2.avi', 999L, '.avi')]
images, anims = reduce(lambda (i, a), f: (i + [f], a) if f[2] in IMAGE_TYPES else (i, a + [f]), files, ([], []))

If the list is made of groups and intermittent separators, you can use:
def split(items, p):
groups = [[]]
for i in items:
if p(i):
groups.append([])
groups[-1].append(i)
return groups
Usage:
split(range(1,11), lambda x: x % 3 == 0)
# gives [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]

This is the fastest way.
It uses  if else , (like dbr's answer) but creates a set first. A set reduces the number of operations from O(m * n) to O(log m) + O(n), resulting in a 45%+ boost in speed.
good_list_set = set(good_list)  # 45% faster than a tuple.
good, bad = [], []
for item in my_origin_list:
if item in good_list_set:
good.append(item)
else:
bad.append(item)
A little shorter:
good_list_set = set(good_list)  # 45% faster than a tuple.
good, bad = [], []
for item in my_origin_list:
out = good if item in good_list_set else bad
out.append(item)

anims  = [f for f in files if f not in images]
Nice when the condition is a longer, such as in your example. The reader doesn't have to figure out the negative condition and whether it captures all other cases.

Yet another answer, short but ""evil"" (for list-comprehension side effects).
digits = list(range(10))
odd = [x.pop(i) for i, x in enumerate(digits) if x % 2]
>>> odd
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>> digits
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

Profile Manager - Create, remove, or switch Firefox profiles
Firefox saves your personal information such as bookmarks, passwords, and user preferences in a set of files called your  profile , which is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files. You can have multiple Firefox profiles, each containing a separate set of user information. The Profile Manager allows you to create, remove, rename, and switch profiles.
If you have (or plan to have) multiple installations of Firefox on one computer, see  Dedicated profiles per Firefox installation .
If you are troubleshooting a problem with Firefox: The  Refresh Firefox feature  can fix many issues by restoring Firefox to its default state while saving your essential information. Consider using it before going through a lengthy troubleshooting process.
Table of Contents 1   Starting the Profile Manager 2   Manage profiles when Firefox is open 3   Start the Profile Manager when Firefox is closed 3.1   Multiple Firefox installations 3.2   Creating a profile 3.3   Removing a profile 3.4   Renaming a profile 4   Options 4.1   Work Offline 4.2   Use the selected profile without asking at startup 5   Use Sync with a new profile 6   Moving a profile 7   Recovering information from an old profile
Starting the Profile Manager
Note : You can manage profiles from the  About Profiles  page when Firefox is open.  If Firefox won't start or you need certain  options , you can also  start the Profile Manager when Firefox is closed .
Manage profiles when Firefox is open
Type  about:profiles  into the address bar and press the  Enter Return  key.  This will open the  About Profiles  page.
The following options are available:
Create a new profile : Click  Create a New Profile  and follow the prompts in the  Create Profile Wizard  (see the  Creating a profile  section below for details). After you finish creating the new profile, it will be listed in the Profile Manager. Click  Set as default profile  underneath that profile, if you want Firefox to use your new profile the next time you start Firefox.
To manage profiles, find the profile you want to change and choose from these buttons underneath that profile:
Rename:  Click this to change the name of a profile in the Profile Manager.  Note:  The folder containing the files for the profile is not renamed.
Remove:  Click this to delete a profile. (The profile in use cannot be deleted.)  Don't Delete Files   is the preferred option. See the  Removing a profile  section below for more information.
Set as default profile:  This option allows you to switch profiles. Click this to make Firefox use this profile at startup.
Launch profile in new browser:   This option is not used to manage profiles. It's intended for advanced users who have launched Firefox with a special startup command. When you click this button, another Firefox window will open using that profile. When you click this button, another Firefox window will open using that profile.
Start the Profile Manager when Firefox is closed
If you have multiple installations of Firefox,  see below .
If Firefox is open, close Firefox:  Click the menu button
and then click  Exit Quit
.
Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Exit .
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click  Quit Firefox . Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Quit .
Press
+ R  on the keyboard. A Run dialog will open.
In the Run dialog box, type in: firefox.exe -P You can use  -P ,  -p  or  -ProfileManager  (any of them should work).
Click  OK . The Firefox Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.
Note:  Another way to start the Profile Manager is from the Search box in the Windows Start menu.  Close Firefox (if open),  press
, type  firefox.exe -P  and press  enter .
If the above instructions do not work or if you have multiple installations of Firefox, use the following instructions instead.
Multiple Firefox installations
You can have multiple Firefox programs installed in different locations. To start the Profile Manager for a specific Firefox installation, replace  firefox.exe  in the above instructions with the full path to the Firefox program, enclose that line in quotes, then add a space followed by -P.
Examples:
Firefox (32-bit) on 64-bit Windows
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -P
Firefox (32-bit) on 32-bit Windows  (or  64-bit Firefox  on 64-bit Windows )
""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -P
If Firefox is open, close Firefox:  Click the menu button
and then click  Exit Quit
.
Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Exit .
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click  Quit Firefox . Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Quit .
Using Finder navigate to  /Applications/Utilities .
Open the  Terminal  application.
In the Terminal application, enter the following: /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -P Note:  If your Firefox application is in a location other than  /Applications/Firefox.app/ , adjust the entry. Important:  there's a space after the path, before  -P  (You can use   -P ,   -p  or   -ProfileManager  after the path; any of them should work.)
Press  Return . The Firefox Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.
Note:  You may need to adjust these instructions if Firefox is installed in a non-default location (for example, when multiple installations exist).
If Firefox is already included in your Linux distribution or if you have installed Firefox with the package manager of your Linux distribution:
If Firefox is open, close Firefox:  Click the menu button
and then click  Exit Quit
.
Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Exit .
Click the Firefox menu at the top of the screen, then click  Quit Firefox . Click the Firefox menu
, then click  Quit .
In  Terminal  run:   firefox -P
The P is capitalized.   Alternatively, you can use  -ProfileManager  instead of  -P .
The Firefox Profile Manager (Choose User Profile) window should open.
If the Profile Manager window  still  does not open, Firefox may have been running in the background, even though it was not visible. Close all instances of Firefox or restart the computer and then try again.
Creating a profile
After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can create a new, additional profile as follows:
In the Profile Manager, click  Create Profile...   to start the Create Profile Wizard.
Click  Next  and enter the name of the profile. Use a profile name that is descriptive, such as your personal name. This name is not exposed on the Internet.
Disregard the  Choose Folder  prompt unless you wish to choose where to store the profile on your computer.  Warning:  If you choose your own folder location for the profile, select a new or empty folder. If you choose a folder that isn't empty and you later remove the profile and choose the ""Delete Files"" option,  everything inside that folder will be deleted.
To create the new profile, click  Finish Done .
You will be taken back to the Profile Manager and the new profile will be listed.
When you first start Firefox with the new profile, you will be prompted to sign in to your Firefox Account so that you can  sync your data with the new profile  (see below).
Removing a profile
After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can remove an existing profile as follows:
In the Profile Manager, select the profile to remove, and click  Delete Profile... .
Confirm that you wish to delete the profile:
Don't Delete Files  removes the profile from the Profile Manager yet retains the profile data files on your computer in the storage folder, so that your information is not lost. ""Don't Delete Files"" is the preferred option because it saves the  old profile's folder and allows you to recover the files to a new profile.
Delete Files  removes the profile and its files (including the profile bookmarks, settings, passwords, etc.). If you use the ""Delete Files"" option, the profile folder and files will be deleted.  This action cannot be undone.
Cancel  interrupts the profile deletion.
Renaming a profile
After starting the Profile Manager as explained above, you can rename a profile as follows:
In the Profile Manager, select the profile to rename, and then click  Rename Profile... .
Enter the new name for the profile. Type in the new profile name, and click on  OK .
Note : The folder containing the files for the profile is not renamed.
Options
These options are only available when you  start the Profile Manager when Firefox is closed .
Work Offline
Choosing this option loads the selected profile and starts Firefox without connecting to the Internet. You can view previously viewed web pages and experiment with your profile.
Use the selected profile without asking at startup
When you have multiple profiles, this option tells Firefox what to do at startup:
If you check this option, Firefox will automatically load the selected profile at startup.  To access other profiles, you must start the Profile Manager first.
If you uncheck this option, Firefox will show you the Profile Manager each time you start Firefox, so that you can select a profile to use.
Use Sync with a new profile
When you first open Firefox with a new profile, you will be prompted to sign in to Sync, which allows different Firefox profiles to share the same bookmarks, browsing history, passwords and other user data.
If you already use Sync in another profile or device, enter the email address and password for your  Firefox Account  and your new profile will use those settings.
If you don't use Sync or if you don't want to sync your data with the new profile, you can skip this step.
See  How do I choose what types of information to sync on Firefox?  and  How do I set up Sync on my computer?  for more information.
Moving a profile
To copy all of your Firefox data and settings to another Firefox installation (e.g. when you get a new computer), you can make a backup of your Firefox profile, then restore it in your new location. For instructions, see  Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles .
Recovering information from an old profile
If you have important information from an old Firefox profile, such as bookmarks, passwords, or user preferences, you can transfer that information to a new Firefox profile by copying the associated files. For instructions, see  Recovering important data from an old profile . You can also switch to a previous profile to recover old profile data. See  Recover user data missing after Firefox update  for details.

Introduction
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising
the standard library in the main Python distribution.  Please see the
companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code
in the C implementation of Python  [1] .
This document and  PEP 257  (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from
Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from
Barry's style guide  [2] .
This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are
identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in
the language itself.
Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any
conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project.
A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds
One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than
it is written.  The guidelines provided here are intended to improve
the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide
spectrum of Python code.  As  PEP 20  says, ""Readability counts"".
A style guide is about consistency.  Consistency with this style guide
is important.  Consistency within a project is more important.
Consistency within one module or function is the most important.
However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide
recommendations just aren't applicable.  When in doubt, use your best
judgment.  Look at other examples and decide what looks best.  And
don't hesitate to ask!
In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with
this PEP!
Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:
When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even
for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe
for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to
clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).
Because the code in question predates the introduction of the
guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of
Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.
Code Lay-out
Indentation
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and
braces, or using a  hanging indent   [7] .  When using a hanging
indent the following should be considered; there should be no
arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to
clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.
Yes:
# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
var_one, var_two, var_three,
var_four):
print(var_one)
# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
No:
# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
var_one, var_two, var_three,
var_four):
print(var_one)
The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines.
Optional:
# Hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces.
foo = long_function_name(
var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
When the conditional part of an  if -statement is long enough to require
that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the
combination of a two character keyword (i.e.  if ), plus a single space,
plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the
subsequent lines of the multiline conditional.  This can produce a visual
conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the  if -statement,
which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces.  This PEP takes no
explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such
conditional lines from the nested suite inside the  if -statement.
Acceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to:
# No extra indentation.
if (this_is_one_thing and
that_is_another_thing):
do_something()
# Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors
# supporting syntax highlighting.
if (this_is_one_thing and
that_is_another_thing):
# Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
do_something()
# Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line.
if (this_is_one_thing
and that_is_another_thing):
do_something()
(Also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary
operators below.)
The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may
either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last
line of list, as in:
my_list = [
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
'a', 'b', 'c',
'd', 'e', 'f',
)
or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that
starts the multiline construct, as in:
my_list = [
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
'a', 'b', 'c',
'd', 'e', 'f',
)
Tabs or Spaces?
Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is
already indented with tabs.
Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.
Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be
converted to using spaces exclusively.
When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with
the  -t  option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes
tabs and spaces.  When using  -tt  these warnings become errors.
These options are highly recommended!
Maximum Line Length
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions
(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72
characters.
Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have
several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code
review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.
The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the
code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to
avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even
if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping
lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all.
Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length.  For code maintained
exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this
issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters,
provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72
characters.
The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting
lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72).
The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied
line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  Long lines
can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in
parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash
for line continuation.
Backslashes may still be appropriate at times.  For example, long,
multiple  with -statements cannot use implicit continuation, so
backslashes are acceptable:
with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
file_2.write(file_1.read())
(See the previous discussion on  multiline if-statements  for further
thoughts on the indentation of such multiline  with -statements.)
Another such case is with  assert  statements.
Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately.
Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?
For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.
But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get
scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is
moved away from its operand and onto the previous line.  Here, the eye
has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are
subtracted:
# No: operators sit far away from their operands
income = (gross_wages +
taxable_interest +
(dividends - qualified_dividends) -
ira_deduction -
student_loan_interest)
To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers
follow the opposite convention.  Donald Knuth explains the traditional
rule in his  Computers and Typesetting  series: ""Although formulas
within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations,
displayed formulas always break before binary operations""  [3] .
Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more
readable code:
# Yes: easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
+ taxable_interest
+ (dividends - qualified_dividends)
- ira_deduction
- student_loan_interest)
In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary
operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally.  For new
code Knuth's style is suggested.
Blank Lines
Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank
lines.
Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank
line.
Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
related functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).
Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
Python accepts the control-L (i.e. ^L) form feed character as
whitespace; Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so
you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.
Note, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize
control-L as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place.
Source File Encoding
Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8 (or ASCII
in Python 2).
Files using ASCII (in Python 2) or UTF-8 (in Python 3) should not have
an encoding declaration.
In the standard library, non-default encodings should be used only for
test purposes or when a comment or docstring needs to mention an author
name that contains non-ASCII characters; otherwise, using  \x ,
\u ,  \U , or  \N  escapes is the preferred way to include
non-ASCII data in string literals.
For Python 3.0 and beyond, the following policy is prescribed for the
standard library (see  PEP 3131 ): All identifiers in the Python
standard library MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use
English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and
technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string
literals and comments must also be in ASCII. The only exceptions are
(a) test cases testing the non-ASCII features, and
(b) names of authors. Authors whose names are not based on the
Latin alphabet (latin-1, ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set) MUST provide
a transliteration of their names in this character set.
Open source projects with a global audience are encouraged to adopt a
similar policy.
Imports
Imports should usually be on separate lines:
Yes: import os
import sys
No:  import sys, os
It's okay to say this though:
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module
comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
Imports should be grouped in the following order:
Standard library imports.
Related third party imports.
Local application/library specific imports.
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.
Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable
and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error
messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as
when a directory inside a package ends up on  sys.path ):
import mypkg.sibling
from mypkg import sibling
from mypkg.sibling import example
However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to
absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts
where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose:
from . import sibling
from .sibling import example
Standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always
use absolute imports.
Implicit relative imports should  never  be used and have been removed
in Python 3.
When importing a class from a class-containing module, it's usually
okay to spell this:
from myclass import MyClass
from foo.bar.yourclass import YourClass
If this spelling causes local name clashes, then spell them explicitly:
import myclass
import foo.bar.yourclass
and use ""myclass.MyClass"" and ""foo.bar.yourclass.YourClass"".
Wildcard imports ( from <module> import * ) should be avoided, as
they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace,
confusing both readers and many automated tools. There is one
defensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an
internal interface as part of a public API (for example, overwriting
a pure Python implementation of an interface with the definitions
from an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions
will be overwritten isn't known in advance).
When republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding
public and internal interfaces still apply.
Module Level Dunder Names
Module level ""dunders"" (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing
underscores) such as  __all__ ,  __author__ ,  __version__ ,
etc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import
statements  except   from __future__  imports.  Python mandates that
future-imports must appear in the module before any other code except
docstrings:
""""""This is the example module.
This module does stuff.
""""""
from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL
__all__ = ['a', 'b', 'c']
__version__ = '0.1'
__author__ = 'Cardinal Biggles'
import os
import sys
String Quotes
In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the
same.  This PEP does not make a recommendation for this.  Pick a rule
and stick to it.  When a string contains single or double quote
characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the
string. It improves readability.
For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be
consistent with the docstring convention in  PEP 257 .
Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
Pet Peeves
Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis.
Yes: foo = (0,)
No:  bar = (0, )
Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:
Yes: if x == 4: print x, y; x, y = y, x
No:  if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x
However, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and
should have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the
operator with the lowest priority).  In an extended slice, both
colons must have the same amount of spacing applied.  Exception:
when a slice parameter is omitted, the space is omitted.
Yes:
ham[1:9], ham[1:9:3], ham[:9:3], ham[1::3], ham[1:9:]
ham[lower:upper], ham[lower:upper:], ham[lower::step]
ham[lower+offset : upper+offset]
ham[: upper_fn(x) : step_fn(x)], ham[:: step_fn(x)]
ham[lower + offset : upper + offset]
No:
ham[lower + offset:upper + offset]
ham[1: 9], ham[1 :9], ham[1:9 :3]
ham[lower : : upper]
ham[ : upper]
Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument
list of a function call:
Yes: spam(1)
No:  spam (1)
Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or
slicing:
Yes: dct['key'] = lst[index]
No:  dct ['key'] = lst [index]
More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to
align it with another.
Yes:
x = 1
y = 2
long_variable = 3
No:
x             = 1
y             = 2
long_variable = 3
Other Recommendations
Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere.  Because it's usually invisible,
it can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a
newline does not count as a line continuation marker.  Some editors
don't preserve it and many projects (like CPython itself) have
pre-commit hooks that reject it.
Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either
side: assignment ( = ), augmented assignment ( += ,  -=
etc.), comparisons ( == ,  < ,  > ,  != ,  <> ,  <= ,
>= ,  in ,  not in ,  is ,  is not ), Booleans ( and ,
or ,  not ).
If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use
your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and
always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary
operator.
Yes:
i = i + 1
submitted += 1
x = x*2 - 1
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
c = (a+b) * (a-b)
No:
i=i+1
submitted +=1
x = x * 2 - 1
hypot2 = x * x + y * y
c = (a + b) * (a - b)
Function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and
always have spaces around the  ->  arrow if present.  (See
Function Annotations  below for more about function annotations.)
Yes:
def munge(input: AnyStr): ...
def munge() -> PosInt: ...
No:
def munge(input:AnyStr): ...
def munge()->PosInt: ...
Don't use spaces around the  =  sign when used to indicate a
keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an
unannotated  function parameter.
Yes:
def complex(real, imag=0.0):
return magic(r=real, i=imag)
No:
def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
return magic(r = real, i = imag)
When combining an argument annotation with a default value, however, do use
spaces around the  =  sign:
Yes:
def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, sep: AnyStr = None, limit=1000): ...
No:
def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, limit = 1000): ...
Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are
generally discouraged.
Yes:
if foo == 'blah':
do_blah_thing()
do_one()
do_two()
do_three()
Rather not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
While sometimes it's okay to put an if/for/while with a small body
on the same line, never do this for multi-clause statements.  Also
avoid folding such long lines!
Rather not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
for x in lst: total += x
while t < 10: t = delay()
Definitely not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
else: do_non_blah_thing()
try: something()
finally: cleanup()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three(long, argument,
list, like, this)
if foo == 'blah': one(); two(); three()
When to Use Trailing Commas
Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when
making a tuple of one element (and in Python 2 they have semantics for
the  print  statement).  For clarity, it is recommended to surround
the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses.
Yes:
FILES = ('setup.cfg',)
OK, but confusing:
FILES = 'setup.cfg',
When trailing commas are redundant, they are often helpful when a
version control system is used, when a list of values, arguments or
imported items is expected to be extended over time.  The pattern is
to put each value (etc.) on a line by itself, always adding a trailing
comma, and add the close parenthesis/bracket/brace on the next line.
However it does not make sense to have a trailing comma on the same
line as the closing delimiter (except in the above case of singleton
tuples).
Yes:
FILES = [
'setup.cfg',
'tox.ini',
]
initialize(FILES,
error=True,
)
No:
FILES = ['setup.cfg', 'tox.ini',]
initialize(FILES, error=True,)
Comments
Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.  Always
make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code
changes!
Comments should be complete sentences.  The first word should be
capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case
letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).
Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of
complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.
You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi-
sentence comments, except after the final sentence.
When writing English, follow Strunk and White.
Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your
comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never
be read by people who don't speak your language.
Block Comments
Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows
them, and are indented to the same level as that code.  Each line of a
block comment starts with a  #  and a single space (unless it is
indented text inside the comment).
Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a
single  # .
Inline Comments
Use inline comments sparingly.
An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.
Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the
statement.  They should start with a # and a single space.
Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state
the obvious.  Don't do this:
x = x + 1                 # Increment x
But sometimes, this is useful:
x = x + 1                 # Compensate for border
Documentation Strings
Conventions for writing good documentation strings
(a.k.a. ""docstrings"") are immortalized in  PEP 257 .
Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and
methods.  Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but
you should have a comment that describes what the method does.  This
comment should appear after the  def  line.
PEP 257  describes good docstring conventions.  Note that most
importantly, the  """"""  that ends a multiline docstring should be
on a line by itself:
""""""Return a foobang
Optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first.
""""""
For one liner docstrings, please keep the closing  """"""  on
the same line.
Naming Conventions
The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so
we'll never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are
the currently recommended naming standards.  New modules and packages
(including third party frameworks) should be written to these
standards, but where an existing library has a different style,
internal consistency is preferred.
Overriding Principle
Names that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should
follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.
Descriptive: Naming Styles
There are a lot of different naming styles.  It helps to be able to
recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what
they are used for.
The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:
b  (single lowercase letter)
B  (single uppercase letter)
lowercase
lower_case_with_underscores
UPPERCASE
UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
CapitalizedWords  (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because
of the bumpy look of its letters  [4] ).  This is also sometimes known
as StudlyCaps.
Note: When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the
letters of the acronym.  Thus HTTPServerError is better than
HttpServerError.
mixedCase  (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase
character!)
Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores  (ugly!)
There's also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related
names together.  This is not used much in Python, but it is mentioned
for completeness.  For example, the  os.stat()  function returns a
tuple whose items traditionally have names like  st_mode ,
st_size ,  st_mtime  and so on.  (This is done to emphasize the
correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which
helps programmers familiar with that.)
The X11 library uses a leading X for all its public functions.  In
Python, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute
and method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are
prefixed with a module name.
In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing
underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any
case convention):
_single_leading_underscore : weak ""internal use"" indicator.
E.g.  from M import *  does not import objects whose names start
with an underscore.
single_trailing_underscore_ : used by convention to avoid
conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.
Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')
__double_leading_underscore : when naming a class attribute,
invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar,  __boo  becomes
_FooBar__boo ; see below).
__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ : ""magic"" objects or
attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces.
E.g.  __init__ ,  __import__  or  __file__ .  Never invent
such names; only use them as documented.
Prescriptive: Naming Conventions
Names to Avoid
Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase
letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable
names.
In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the
numerals one and zero.  When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.
ASCII Compatibility
Identifiers used in the standard library must be ASCII compatible
as described in the
policy section
of  PEP 3131 .
Package and Module Names
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names.  Underscores can be
used in the module name if it improves readability.  Python packages
should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of
underscores is discouraged.
When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying
Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented)
interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore
(e.g.  _socket ).
Class Names
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where
the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.
Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin
names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords
convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.
Type Variable Names
Names of type variables introduced in  PEP 484  should normally use CapWords
preferring short names:  T ,  AnyStr ,  Num . It is recommended to add
suffixes  _co  or  _contra  to the variables used to declare covariant
or contravariant behavior correspondingly:
from typing import TypeVar
VT_co = TypeVar('VT_co', covariant=True)
KT_contra = TypeVar('KT_contra', contravariant=True)
Exception Names
Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention
applies here.  However, you should use the suffix ""Error"" on your
exception names (if the exception actually is an error).
Global Variable Names
(Let's hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module
only.)  The conventions are about the same as those for functions.
Modules that are designed for use via  from M import *  should use
the  __all__  mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the
older convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which
you might want to do to indicate these globals are ""module
non-public"").
Function and Variable Names
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by
underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the
prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards
compatibility.
Function and Method Arguments
Always use  self  for the first argument to instance methods.
Always use  cls  for the first argument to class methods.
If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is
generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than
use an abbreviation or spelling corruption.  Thus  class_  is better
than  clss .  (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a
synonym.)
Method Names and Instance Variables
Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by
underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance
variables.
To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to
invoke Python's name mangling rules.
Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an
attribute named  __a , it cannot be accessed by  Foo.__a .  (An
insistent user could still gain access by calling  Foo._Foo__a .)
Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid
name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.
Note: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see below).
Constants
Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all
capital letters with underscores separating words.  Examples include
MAX_OVERFLOW  and  TOTAL .
Designing for Inheritance
Always decide whether a class's methods and instance variables
(collectively: ""attributes"") should be public or non-public.  If in
doubt, choose non-public; it's easier to make it public later than to
make a public attribute non-public.
Public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your
class to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible
changes.  Non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be
used by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public
attributes won't change or even be removed.
We don't use the term ""private"" here, since no attribute is really
private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work).
Another category of attributes are those that are part of the
""subclass API"" (often called ""protected"" in other languages).  Some
classes are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify
aspects of the class's behavior.  When designing such a class, take
care to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public,
which are part of the subclass API, and which are truly only to be
used by your base class.
With this in mind, here are the Pythonic guidelines:
Public attributes should have no leading underscores.
If your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword,
append a single trailing underscore to your attribute name.  This is
preferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling.  (However,
notwithstanding this rule, 'cls' is the preferred spelling for any
variable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the
first argument to a class method.)
Note 1: See the argument name recommendation above for class methods.
For simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the
attribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods.  Keep
in mind that Python provides an easy path to future enhancement,
should you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow
functional behavior.  In that case, use properties to hide
functional implementation behind simple data attribute access
syntax.
Note 1: Properties only work on new-style classes.
Note 2: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free,
although side-effects such as caching are generally fine.
Note 3: Avoid using properties for computationally expensive
operations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that
access is (relatively) cheap.
If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes
that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with
double leading underscores and no trailing underscores.  This
invokes Python's name mangling algorithm, where the name of the
class is mangled into the attribute name.  This helps avoid
attribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain
attributes with the same name.
Note 1: Note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled
name, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute
name, you can still get name collisions.
Note 2: Name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and
__getattr__() , less convenient.  However the name mangling
algorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually.
Note 3: Not everyone likes name mangling.  Try to balance the
need to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by
advanced callers.
Public and Internal Interfaces
Any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces.
Accordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish
between public and internal interfaces.
Documented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation
explicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt
from the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. All undocumented
interfaces should be assumed to be internal.
To better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the
names in their public API using the  __all__  attribute. Setting
__all__  to an empty list indicates that the module has no public API.
Even with  __all__  set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages,
modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be
prefixed with a single leading underscore.
An interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace
(package, module or class) is considered internal.
Imported names should always be considered an implementation detail.
Other modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names
unless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module's
API, such as  os.path  or a package's  __init__  module that exposes
functionality from submodules.
Programming Recommendations
Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other
implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython, Cython, Psyco,
and such).
For example, do not rely on CPython's efficient implementation of
in-place string concatenation for statements in the form  a += b
or  a = a + b .  This optimization is fragile even in CPython (it
only works for some types) and isn't present at all in implementations
that don't use refcounting.  In performance sensitive parts of the
library, the  ''.join()  form should be used instead.  This will
ensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various
implementations.
Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with
is  or  is not , never the equality operators.
Also, beware of writing  if x  when you really mean  if x is not
None  -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that
defaults to None was set to some other value.  The other value might
have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean
context!
Use  is not  operator rather than  not ... is .  While both
expressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable
and preferred.
Yes:
if foo is not None:
No:
if not foo is None:
When implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is
best to implement all six operations ( __eq__ ,  __ne__ ,
__lt__ ,  __le__ ,  __gt__ ,  __ge__ ) rather than relying
on other code to only exercise a particular comparison.
To minimize the effort involved, the  functools.total_ordering()
decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods.
PEP 207  indicates that reflexivity rules  are  assumed by Python.
Thus, the interpreter may swap  y > x  with  x < y ,  y >= x
with  x <= y , and may swap the arguments of  x == y  and  x !=
y .  The  sort()  and  min()  operations are guaranteed to use
the  <  operator and the  max()  function uses the  >
operator.  However, it is best to implement all six operations so
that confusion doesn't arise in other contexts.
Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds
a lambda expression directly to an identifier.
Yes:
def f(x): return 2*x
No:
f = lambda x: 2*x
The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is
specifically 'f' instead of the generic '<lambda>'. This is more
useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use
of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda
expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can
be embedded inside a larger expression)
Derive exceptions from  Exception  rather than  BaseException .
Direct inheritance from  BaseException  is reserved for exceptions
where catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do.
Design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code
catching  the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations
where the exceptions are raised. Aim to answer the question
""What went wrong?"" programmatically, rather than only stating that
""A problem occurred"" (see  PEP 3151  for an example of this lesson being
learned for the builtin exception hierarchy)
Class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the
suffix ""Error"" to your exception classes if the exception is an
error.  Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control
or other forms of signaling need no special suffix.
Use exception chaining appropriately. In Python 3, ""raise X from Y""
should be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the
original traceback.
When deliberately replacing an inner exception (using ""raise X"" in
Python 2 or ""raise X from None"" in Python 3.3+), ensure that relevant
details are transferred to the new exception (such as preserving the
attribute name when converting KeyError to AttributeError, or
embedding the text of the original exception in the new exception
message).
When raising an exception in Python 2, use  raise  ValueError('message')
instead of the older form  raise ValueError, 'message' .
The latter form is not legal Python 3 syntax.
The paren-using form also means that when the exception arguments are
long or include string formatting, you don't need to use line
continuation characters thanks to the containing parentheses.
When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever
possible instead of using a bare  except:  clause:
try:
import platform_specific_module
except ImportError:
platform_specific_module = None
A bare  except:  clause will catch SystemExit and
KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a
program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems.  If you
want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use
except Exception:  (bare except is equivalent to  except
BaseException: ).
A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare 'except' clauses to two
cases:
If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the
traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has
occurred.
If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the
exception propagate upwards with  raise .   try...finally
can be a better way to handle this case.
When binding caught exceptions to a name, prefer the explicit name
binding syntax added in Python 2.6:
try:
process_data()
except Exception as exc:
raise DataProcessingFailedError(str(exc))
This is the only syntax supported in Python 3, and avoids the
ambiguity problems associated with the older comma-based syntax.
When catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception
hierarchy introduced in Python 3.3 over introspection of  errno
values.
Additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the  try  clause
to the absolute minimum amount of code necessary.  Again, this
avoids masking bugs.
Yes:
try:
value = collection[key]
except KeyError:
return key_not_found(key)
else:
return handle_value(value)
No:
try:
# Too broad!
return handle_value(collection[key])
except KeyError:
# Will also catch KeyError raised by handle_value()
return key_not_found(key)
When a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a
with  statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably
after use. A try/finally statement is also acceptable.
Context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods
whenever they do something other than acquire and release resources.
Yes:
with conn.begin_transaction():
do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
No:
with conn:
do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
The latter example doesn't provide any information to indicate that
the  __enter__  and  __exit__  methods are doing something other
than closing the connection after a transaction.  Being explicit is
important in this case.
Be consistent in return statements.  Either all return statements in
a function should return an expression, or none of them should.  If
any return statement returns an expression, any return statements
where no value is returned should explicitly state this as  return
None , and an explicit return statement should be present at the
end of the function (if reachable).
Yes:
def foo(x):
if x >= 0:
return math.sqrt(x)
else:
return None
def bar(x):
if x < 0:
return None
return math.sqrt(x)
No:
def foo(x):
if x >= 0:
return math.sqrt(x)
def bar(x):
if x < 0:
return
return math.sqrt(x)
Use string methods instead of the string module.
String methods are always much faster and share the same API with
unicode strings.  Override this rule if backwards compatibility with
Pythons older than 2.0 is required.
Use  ''.startswith()  and  ''.endswith()  instead of string
slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes.
startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone:
Yes: if foo.startswith('bar'):
No:  if foo[:3] == 'bar':
Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of
comparing types directly.
Yes: if isinstance(obj, int):
No:  if type(obj) is type(1):
When checking if an object is a string, keep in mind that it might
be a unicode string too!  In Python 2, str and unicode have a
common base class, basestring, so you can do:
if isinstance(obj, basestring):
Note that in Python 3,  unicode  and  basestring  no longer exist
(there is only  str ) and a bytes object is no longer a kind of
string (it is a sequence of integers instead).
For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty
sequences are false.
Yes: if not seq:
if seq:
No:  if len(seq):
if not len(seq):
Don't write string literals that rely on significant trailing
whitespace.  Such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable
and some editors (or more recently, reindent.py) will trim them.
Don't compare boolean values to True or False using  == .
Yes:   if greeting:
No:    if greeting == True:
Worse: if greeting is True:
Use of the flow control statements  return / break / continue
within the finally suite of a  try...finally , where the flow control
statement would jump outside the finally suite, is discouraged.  This
is because such statements will implicitly cancel any active exception
that is propagating through the finally suite.
No:
def foo():
try:
1 / 0
finally:
return 42
Function Annotations
With the acceptance of  PEP 484 , the style rules for function
annotations are changing.
In order to be forward compatible, function annotations in Python 3
code should preferably use  PEP 484  syntax.  (There are some
formatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section.)
The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended
previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged.
However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of  PEP 484
are now encouraged.  For example, marking up a large third party
library or application with  PEP 484  style type annotations,
reviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing
whether their presence increases code understandability.
The Python standard library should be conservative in adopting such
annotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big
refactorings.
For code that wants to make a different use of function annotations
it is recommended to put a comment of the form:
# type: ignore
near the top of the file; this tells type checker to ignore all
annotations.  (More fine-grained ways of disabling complaints from
type checkers can be found in  PEP 484 .)
Like linters, type checkers are optional, separate tools.  Python
interpreters by default should not issue any messages due to type
checking and should not alter their behavior based on annotations.
Users who don't want to use type checkers are free to ignore them.
However, it is expected that users of third party library packages
may want to run type checkers over those packages.  For this purpose
PEP 484  recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read
by the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files.
Stub files can be distributed with a library, or separately (with
the library author's permission) through the typeshed repo  [5] .
For code that needs to be backwards compatible, type annotations
can be added in the form of comments.  See the relevant section of
PEP 484   [6] .
Variable Annotations
PEP 526  introduced variable annotations. The style recommendations for them are
similar to those on function annotations described above:
Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,
and local variables should have a single space after the colon.
There should be no space before the colon.
If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have
exactly one space on both sides.
Yes:
code: int
class Point:
coords: Tuple[int, int]
label: str = '<unknown>'
No:
code:int  # No space after colon
code : int  # Space before colon
class Test:
result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign
Although the  PEP 526  is accepted for Python 3.6, the variable annotation
syntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of Python
(see  PEP 484  for details).
Footnotes
[7] Hanging indentation  is a type-setting style where all
the lines in a paragraph are indented except the first line.  In
the context of Python, the term is used to describe a style where
the opening parenthesis of a parenthesized statement is the last
non-whitespace character of the line, with subsequent lines being
indented until the closing parenthesis.

Just leaving this as an alternative if it is required to start a Powershell childprocess instantly as UTF8 (including pipes) without running an external script:
Powershell.exe -NoExit -Command ""$OutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = [Text.UTF8Encoding]::UTF8""

I know that it is possible to create a temporary file, and write the data of the file I wish to copy to it.  I was just wondering if there was a function like:
create_temporary_copy(file_path)
python

What operating system are you using?  Do you need something cross-platform?
–  Steven Rumbalski
Jul 5 '11 at 19:03
yah, i need something cross-platform.  I found a question under ""Related"" that answers my question.   temp_path = tempfile.mktemp()   shutil.copyfile(file_to_be_copied, temp_path)

There isn't one directly, but you can use a combination of  tempfile  and  shutil.copy2  to achieve the same result:
import tempfile, shutil, os
def create_temporary_copy(path):
temp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()
temp_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'temp_file_name')
shutil.copy2(path, temp_path)
return temp_path
You'll need to deal with removing the temporary file in the caller, though.

thanks, this is a pretty concise way of writing one.

or replace the first two lines in the function with:  fd, temp_path = tempfile.mkstemp() .

This isn't quite as concise, and I imagine there may be issues with exception safety, (e.g. what happens if 'original_path' doesn't exist, or the temporary_copy object goes out of scope while you have the file open) but this code adds a little RAII to the clean up. The difference here to using NamedTemporaryFile directly is that rather than ending up with a file object, you end up with a file, which is occasionally desirable (e.g. if you plan to call out to other code to read it, or some such.)
import os,shutil,tempfile
class temporary_copy(object):
def __init__(self,original_path):
self.original_path = original_path
def __enter__(self):
temp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()
base_path = os.path.basename(self.original_path)
self.path = os.path.join(temp_dir,base_path)
shutil.copy2(self.original_path, self.path)
return self.path
def __exit__(self,exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
os.remove(self.path)
in your code you'd write:
with temporary_copy(path) as temporary_path_to_copy:
... do stuff with temporary_path_to_copy ...
# Here in the code, the copy should now have been deleted.

A variation on @tramdas's answer, accounting for the fact that the file cannot be opened twice on windows. This version ignores the preservation of the file extension.
import os, shutil, tempfile
def create_temporary_copy(src):
# create the temporary file in read/write mode (r+)
tf = tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='r+b', prefix='__', suffix='.tmp')
# on windows, we can't open the the file again, either manually
# or indirectly via shutil.copy2, but we *can* copy
# the file directly using file-like objects, which is what
# TemporaryFile returns to us.
# Use `with open` here to automatically close the source file
with open(src,'r+b') as f:
shutil.copyfileobj(f,tf)
# display the name of the temporary file for diagnostic purposes
print 'temp file:',tf.name
# rewind the temporary file, otherwise things will go
# tragically wrong on Windows
tf.seek(0)
return tf
# make a temporary copy of the file 'foo.txt'
name = None
with create_temporary_copy('foo.txt') as temp:
name = temp.name
# prove that it exists
print 'exists', os.path.isfile(name) # prints True
# read all lines from the file
i = 0
for line in temp:
print i,line.strip()
i += 1
# temp.close() is implicit using `with`
# prove that it has been deleted
print 'exists', os.path.isfile(name) # prints False

A slight variation (in particular I needed the  preserve_extension  feature for my use case, and I like the ""self-cleanup"" feature):
import os, shutil, tempfile
def create_temporary_copy(src_file_name, preserve_extension=False):
'''
Copies the source file into a temporary file.
Returns a _TemporaryFileWrapper, whose destructor deletes the temp file
(i.e. the temp file is deleted when the object goes out of scope).
'''
tf_suffix=''
if preserve_extension:
_, tf_suffix = os.path.splitext(src_file_name)
tf = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=tf_suffix)
shutil.copy2(src_file_name, tf.name)
return tf

The line  shutil.copy2()  gives me  Permission denied  error (at least, on Windows)
–  cod3monk3y
Nov 13 '14 at 20:12
Sorry, I don't have access to a Windows machine to test (I'm on OSX). Could be that the default path used by  NamedTemporaryFile  isn't sensible on Windows; could you print out  tf.name  before the  shutil.copy2  to see where it's creating the file?

IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'c:\\users\\MYNAME\\appdata\\local\\temp\\tmpt7m7ix.tmp' . I tested on Linux and it works fine. I'm assuming  NamedTemporaryFile  is opening an exclusive handle on the temporary file on Windows. I have write access to that directory and can manually create files just fine, or create a file in the temporary directory as listed in @TorelTwiddler's response.

According to  this post  (and the docs), the file handle opened by  TemporaryFile  cannot be re-opened on Windows NT and later.  shutil.copy2  attempts to open the file again for a copy, thus the error.

I posted a variation that works on windows using  shutil.copyfileobj , accounting for these differences.

I'm working on a text adventure game and wanted to play a sound when you get a game over. I'm using PyGame to do this but it gives me an invalid syntax error on the last single quote when I try to load the sound file. here is the code:
import pygame
import time
pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100, 16, 2, 4096)
pygame.init()
snd_dir = path.join(path.dirname (_Dog-Walking-Simulator_) 'Game_Over_Yeah.wav')
If I could get help soon that would be great.

Also,  Dog-Walking-Simulator  isn't a valid variable name because of the dashes.

There's a couple things wrong,
_Dog-Walking-Simulator_  is not a valid variable name (dashes aren't allowed). But even if it were a valid variable name, it's not defined. Perhaps you meant  __file__ ?
path  is not imported:  from os import path  needs to be added to the imports at the top
There's no comma separating the parameters passed to  path.join :  path.join(path.dirname(__file__), 'Game_Over_Yeah.wav')

Virtualenv uses wrong python, even though it is first in $PATH
Ask Question

I had a problem where  python  was not finding modules installed by pip while in the virtualenv.
I have narrowed it down, and found that when I call  python  when my virtualenv in activated, it still reaches out to  /usr/bin/python  instead of  /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python .
When I use  which python  in the virtualenv I get:
/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python
When I look up my  $PATH  variable in the virtualenv I get:
bash: /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin: No such file or directory
and yet when I actually run  python  it goes to  /usr/bin/python
To make things more confusing to me, if I run  python3.5  it grabs python3.5 from the correct directory (i.e.  /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python3.5 )
I have not touched  /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/  in anyway.  python  and  python3.5  are still both linked to  python3  in that directory. Traversing to  /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/  and running  ./python ,  ./python3  or  ./python3.5  all work normally.
I am using  virtualenvwrapper  if that makes a difference, however the problem seemed to occur recently, long after install  virtualenv  and  virtualenvwrapper

If you don't get the program that  which  says you should get, you need to look higher up the chain than the platform executor. Shells typically have a way to alias commands and on most unixy shells you can just enter  alias  to see which commands have been remapped. Then its just a matter of going to the config files for your shell and removing the alias.
Sometimes people alias  python  to try to sort out which python they should be using. But there are usually other, better ways. On my linux machine, for example,  python3  is in the path but is a symlink to the real python I am using.
td@mintyfresh ~ $ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
td@mintyfresh ~ $ ls -l /usr/bin/python3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb 17  2016 /usr/bin/python3 -> python3.4
td@mintyfresh ~ $
This is nice because non-shell programs running python get the same one I do and virtual environments work naturally.

My problem was that i recently  moved  my project with virtualenv to another location, due to this  activate  script had  wrong   VIRTUAL_ENV  path.
$ cat path_to_your_env/bin/activate
... # some declarations
VIRTUAL_ENV=""/path_to_your_env/bin/python""  # <-- THIS LINE
export VIRTUAL_ENV
... # some declarations
To fix this, just update  VIRTUAL_ENV  in  activate  script.
Also you maybe need to fix first line of your  bin/pip  to link to real python path.

As  tdelaney  suggested in the comments, I ran  alias  and found that I had previously aliased  python  to  /usr/bin/python3.5  in my  .bashrc .
I removed that alias from my  .bashrc , ran  unalias python , and  source ~/.bashrc  and the problem was solved.

On Cygwin, I still have a problem even after I created symlink to point  /usr/bin/python  to  F:\Python27\python.exe . Here, after  source env/Scripts/activate ,  which python  is still  /usr/bin/python .
After a long time, I figured out a solution. Instead of using  virtualenv env , you have to use  virtualenv -p F:\Python27\python.exe env  even though you have created a symlink.

I'm currently having the same problem. Virtualenv was created in Windows, now I'm trying to run it from WSL.
In virtualenv I renamed python.exe to python3.exe(as I have only python3 command in WSL). In $PATH my virtualenv folder is first, there is no alias for python. I receive  which python3
/usr/bin/python3 . In  /usr/bin/python3  there is symlink `python3 -> python3.6. I suppose it doesn't matter for order resolution.

How to check if a function is callable with parameters?
Ask Question

I'm calling a function with call_user_func_array :
call_user_func_array(array($this, 'myFunction'), array('param1', 'param2', 'param3'));
Everything is ok unless I don't know how many parameters the function needs.
If the function needs 4 parameters it sends me an error, I'd like to test if I can call the function (with an array of parameters).
is_callable() doesn't allow parameters check.
Edit : If the call fails I need to call another function, that's why I need a check.
Thanks!

You could use reflection to get the number of parameters:
$refl = new ReflectionMethod(get_class($this), 'myFunction');
$numParams = $refl->getNumberOfParameters();
or
$numParams = $refl->getNumberOfRequiredParameters();
See  here  for some more information

ReflectionFunction might work better with just functions.

Jan 31 '09 at 11:21
yes but the callback in the question is array($this, 'myFunction') , which implies the code is calling a method on itself

One way getting around this is to call the function always with a  lot  of arguments. PHP is designed in such a way that you can pass as many extraneous arguments as you want, and the excess ones are just ignored by the function definition.
See manual entry for  func_get_args()  to see an illustration about this.
Edit:  As user crescentfresh pointed out, this doesn't work with built-in functions, only user defined functions. If you try to pass too many (or few) arguments into a built-in function, you'll get the following warning:
Warning: Wrong parameter count for strpos() in Command line code on line [...]

It will fail for many built-in functions. Only userspace functions are the ones that php is forgiving of wrt superfluous args.

Version Comparison
A comparison of the abilities and limitations of CentOS Linux can be found  here on the wiki .
End-Of-Life
In general every release receives bugfixes, feature enhancements and new hardware support until 4 years after general availability, and security fixes until 7 years after general availability (beginning with CentOS Linux 5, this period has been extended from 4 to approx. 7 and from 7 to 10 years {assuming the upstream sources remain available for ten years})  For more information about the support life cycle of CentOS Linux, take a look at  Red Hat's Errata Support Policy  page.  Basically, if source is released publicly upstream, the CentOS Project will build and release updates for as long as possible.  We have done this for all previous versions and will for all future versions.   Please note Red Hat's policy on Production Phase 3, which normally starts at the 7 year point.  In that phase, only those security updates deemed  crucial  are released in this phase.  It is recommended that you plan to upgrade before this point whenever possible.
New releases
New major and minor releases are available about 2 to 6 weeks after upstream (Red Hat) publishes the SRPMs (source packages) of their product. This time is needed to rebuild, validate, test (QA), translate and integrate new artwork. Please see  The CentOS Rebuild and Release Process  for further details. Although we understand that some of our users are excited about a new upcoming release, we ask you to be patient or help out in the release process.   The CentOS project does not offer any of the various approaches to extended life for an earlier  point release  which its upstream occasionally does for its subscribing clientèle.  Once a new point release is issued (say: 6.3, following 6.2), no further source packages (from which updates can be built) are released for the earlier version and therefore CentOS is no longer able to produce security or other updates. After a transition interval of a few weeks, the old  point version  binaries are moved to the  vault .  There is a  longer discussion at item 15  in the FAQ for more details.
Variety of ISO images
Aside from the normal DVD and CD ISO images, the CentOS project occasionally releases special ISO images.  Not all point releases get fresh spins of what is substantially unchanging content; if the  latest and greatest  refresh point spin does not have what you seek, you may wish to use the last version seen for a LiveCD or ServerCD, and as appropriate run updates in a post-install process:  LiveCD - Bootable CD image with a working environment directly from CD  ServerCD - Installable CD image with a limited package-set for server installations  netinstall - Minimal CD image to start network installations (<10M)  The netinstall iso will only work with the corresponding point release, eg one cannot use the netinstall from CentOS Linux 6.2 to install CentOS Linux 6.3.

Changes to CentOS: What CentOS Stream means for developers
By  Bob Davis   September 24, 2019 September 30, 2019
Today  Chris Wright , vice president and CTO at Red Hat, published  a post describing how CentOS is changing  and the opportunities it opens for developers in the Red Hat Enterprise  Linux  (RHEL) ecosystem. The net effect of this change is that, in addition to  CentOS  Linux 8, there is a new version of CentOS—CentOS Stream—which will provide a “rolling preview” of future Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels and features. This is being announced in addition to the release of the traditional CentOS Linux 8, which is a downstream rebuild of the current RHEL release.
CentOS Stream is an exciting addition to the family of Linux operating systems that are upstream and downstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
CentOS Stream will live in-between  Fedora  and  RHEL , providing a clearer vision of what the next version of RHEL will be, giving developers the opportunity to stay a step or two ahead in their planning, and making it easier to ensure next-generation applications will be compatible with future RHEL versions. CentOS Stream also will make contributing to future versions of RHEL much simpler and more direct.
Everything you need to grow your career.   With your free Red Hat Developer program membership, unlock our library of cheat sheets and ebooks on next-generation application development.
SIGN UP
This clearly benefits ecosystem developers writing hardware drivers or extending protocols for RHEL, and can give application developers a testbed for applications they want to deploy on future RHEL versions. We hope this will bring even more community engagement to Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL, continuing our “upstream first” policy.
Fedora has always been our upstream “proving ground” where the community innovates and experiments, and that won’t change. If you’re interested in reading more about Fedora, and the relationship between Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL, read Matthew Miller’s  new article on the topic .
In addition to the existing releases of CentOS Linux, CentOS Stream, and Fedora, all  Red Hat Developer  members have access to no-cost RHEL via a  no-cost subscription . These options should make sure that, no matter what problem you’re trying to solve, there’s a Linux distro that best suits your particular needs.
More information on why RHEL is a fantastic platform for application development can be found in the blog post “ Why you should be developing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux .”
For container-based applications, Universal Base Images will provide the flexibility needed to deploy across multiple Linux distributions, which should include CentOS Stream. We encourage developers building applications that will run in VMs or on bare metal to explore Red Hat Enterprise Linux for your production platform, and take advantage of the no-cost RHEL available through Red Hat Developer for your development needs.
We’d love to hear about how CentOS Stream will fit into your software development practices, and encourage your feedback.

Changing PowerShell's default output encoding to UTF-8

By default, when you redirect the output of a command to a file or pipe it into something else in PowerShell, the encoding is UTF-16, which isn't useful. I'm looking to change it to UTF-8.
It can be done on a case-by-case basis by replacing the  >foo.txt  syntax with  | out-file foo.txt -encoding utf8  but this is awkward to have to repeat every time.
The persistent way to set things in PowerShell is to put them in  \Users\me\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1 ; I've verified that this file is indeed executed on startup.
It has been said that the output encoding can be set with  $PSDefaultParameterValues = @{'Out-File:Encoding' = 'utf8'}  but I've tried this and it had no effect.
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2006/12/11/outputencoding-to-the-rescue/  which talks about  $OutputEncoding  looks at first glance as though it should be relevant, but then it talks about output being encoded in ASCII, which is not what's actually happening.
How do you set PowerShell to use UTF-8?

Note: The following applies to  Windows PowerShell . See the next section for the cross-platform PowerShell  Core  edition.
On  PSv5.1 or higher , where  >  and  >>  are effectively aliases of  Out-File , you can  set the default encoding for  >  /  >>  /  Out-File  via the  $PSDefaultParameterValues  preference variable :
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
On  PSv5.0 or below , you  cannot  change the encoding for  >  /  >> , but, on  PSv3 or higher , the above technique  does  work for explicit calls to  Out-File .
(The  $PSDefaultParameterValues  preference variable was introduced in PSv3.0).
On  PSv3.0 or higher , if you want to  set the default encoding for  all  cmdlets that support
an  -Encoding  parameter  (which in PSv5.1+ includes  >  and  >> ), use:
$PSDefaultParameterValues['*:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
If you place this command in your  $PROFILE , cmdlets such  as  Out-File  and  Set-Content  will use UTF-8 encoding by default, but note that this makes it a  session-global setting  that will affect all commands / scripts that do not explicitly specify an encoding.
Similarly,  be sure to include such commands in your scripts or modules that you want to behave the same way , so that they indeed behave the same even when run by another user or a different machine.
Caveat :  PowerShell, as of v5.1,  invariably  creates UTF-8 files  with a  (pseudo) BOM , which is customary only in the  Windows  world -  Unix -based utilities do not recognize this BOM (see bottom); see  this post  for workarounds that create BOM-less UTF-8 files.
For a  summary of the wildly inconsistent default character encoding behavior across many of the Windows PowerShell standard cmdlets , see the bottom section.
The automatic  $OutputEncoding  variable is  unrelated , and only applies to how PowerShell communicates with  external programs  (what encoding PowerShell uses when sending strings to them) - it has nothing to do with the encoding that the output redirection operators and PowerShell cmdlets use to save to files.
Optional reading: The cross-platform perspective: PowerShell  Core :
PowerShell is now cross-platform , via its  PowerShell  Core  edition, whose encoding - sensibly -  defaults to  BOM-less UTF-8 , in line with Unix-like platforms.
This means that source-code files without a BOM are assumed to be UTF-8, and using  >  /  Out-File  /  Set-Content  defaults to  BOM-less  UTF-8; explicit use of the  utf8   -Encoding  argument too creates  BOM-less  UTF-8, but you can opt to create files  with  the pseudo-BOM with the  utf8bom  value.
If you create PowerShell scripts with an editor on a Unix-like platform and nowadays even on  Windows  with cross-platform editors such as Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text, the resulting  *.ps1  file will typically  not  have a UTF-8 pseudo-BOM:
This works fine on PowerShell  Core .
It may break on  Windows PowerShell , if the file contains non-ASCII characters; if you do need to use non-ASCII characters in your scripts, save them as UTF-8  with BOM .
Without the BOM, Windows PowerShell (mis)interprets your script as being encoded in the legacy ""ANSI"" codepage (determined by the system locale for pre-Unicode applications; e.g., Windows-1252 on US-English systems).
Conversely, files that  do  have the UTF-8 pseudo-BOM can be problematic on Unix-like platforms, as they cause Unix utilities such as  cat ,  sed , and  awk  - and even some editors such as  gedit  - to  pass the pseudo-BOM through , i.e., to treat it as  data .
This may not  always  be a problem, but definitely can be, such as when you try to read a file into a string in  bash  with, say,  text=$(cat file)  or  text=$(<file)  - the resulting variable will contain the pseudo-BOM as the first 3 bytes.
Inconsistent default encoding behavior in  Windows PowerShell :
Regrettably, the default character encoding used in Windows PowerShell is wildly inconsistent; the cross-platform PowerShell  Core  edition, as discussed in the previous section, has commendably put and end to this.
Note:
The following doesn't aspire to cover  all  standard cmdlets.
Googling cmdlet names to find their help topics now shows you the PowerShell  Core  version of the topics by default; use the version drop-down list above the list of topics on the left to switch to a  Windows PowerShell  version.
As of this writing, the documentation frequently incorrectly claims that ASCII is the default encoding in Windows PowerShell - see  this GitHub docs issue .
Cmdlets that  write :
Out-File  and  >  /  >>  create ""Unicode"" -  UTF-16LE  - files by default - in which every ASCII-range character (too) is represented by  2  bytes - which notably differs from  Set-Content  /  Add-Content  (see next point);  New-ModuleManifest  and  Export-CliXml  also create UTF-16LE files.
Set-Content  (and  Add-Content  if the file doesn't yet exist / is empty) uses ANSI encoding (the encoding specified by the active system locale's ANSI legacy code page, which PowerShell calls  Default ).
Export-Csv  indeed creates ASCII files, as documented, but see the notes re  -Append  below.
Export-PSSession  creates UTF-8 files with BOM by default.
New-Item -Type File -Value  currently creates BOM-less(!) UTF-8.
The  Send-MailMessage  help topic also claims that ASCII encoding is the default - I have not personally verified that claim.
Re commands that  append  to an existing file:
>>  /  Out-File -Append  make  no  attempt to match the encoding of a file's  existing content .
That is, they blindly apply their default encoding, unless instructed otherwise with  -Encoding , which is not an option with  >>  (except indirectly in PSv5.1+, via  $PSDefaultParameterValues , as shown above).
In short: you must know the encoding of an existing file's content and append using that same encoding.
Add-Content  is the laudable exception: in the absence of an explicit  -Encoding  argument, it detects the existing encoding and automatically applies it to the new content. Thanks,  js2010 . Note that in Windows PowerShell this means that it is ANSI encoding that is applied if the existing content has no BOM, whereas it is UTF-8 in PowerShell Core.
This inconsistency between  Out-File -Append  /  >>  and  Add-Content , which also affects PowerShell  Core , is discussed in  this GitHub issue .
Export-Csv -Append   partially  matches the existing encoding: it blindly appends  UTF-8  if the existing file's encoding is any of ASCII/UTF-8/ANSI, but correctly matches UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE.
To put it differently: in the absence of a BOM,  Export-Csv -Append  assumes UTF-8 is, whereas  Add-Content  assumes ANSI.
Cmdlets that  read  (encoding used in the absence of a BOM):
Get-Content  and  Import-PowerShellDataFile  default to ANSI ( Default ), which is consistent with  Set-Content .
ANSI is also what the PowerShell engine itself defaults to when it reads  source code  from files.
By contrast,  Import-Csv ,  Import-CliXml  and  Select-String  assume UTF-8 in the absence of a BOM.

Can you explain how > / >>  became effective aliases for  Out-File  in 5.1?

@TheIncorrigible1: It may have been PetSerAl who pointed it out to me, but I don't remember where and how. Windows PowerShell is closed-source, but since the same quasi-alias relationship applies to PowerShell Core too, you should be able to find it in the latter's source code.

I don't disagree, @EliaWeiss, but it's Windows PowerShell specifically, and they eventually did get it right in PowerShell  Core .

@Marc: VS Code and other modern cross-platform editors commendably default to UTF-8, which, however, means they'll misinterpret ANSI-encoded files. Notepad uses  heuristics  to  guess  the encoding. The point is that it is only a  guess , because any UTF-8-encoded file is also a technically valid ANSI-encoded file (but not vice versa). It would be great if everything on Windows defaulted to UTF-8 in the absence of a BOM the way Unix-like platforms do, but that's not the case, notably not in Windows PowerShell, though fortunately it is now the case in PowerShell Core.

I have made some repetitive operations in my application (testing it), and suddenly I’m getting a weird error:
OperationalError: database is locked
I've restarted the server, but the error persists. What can it be all about?
python   django   database   sqlite   locked

From django doc:
SQLite is meant to be a lightweight
database, and thus can't support a
high level of concurrency.
OperationalError: database is locked
errors indicate that your application
is experiencing more concurrency than
sqlite can handle in default
configuration. This error means that
one thread or process has an exclusive
lock on the database connection and
another thread timed out waiting for
the lock the be released.
Python's SQLite wrapper has a default
timeout value that determines how long
the second thread is allowed to wait
on the lock before it times out and
raises the OperationalError: database
is locked error.
If you're getting this error, you can
solve it by:
Switching to another database backend.
At a certain point SQLite becomes too
""lite"" for real-world applications,
and these sorts of concurrency errors
indicate you've reached that point.
Rewriting your code to reduce
concurrency and ensure that database
transactions are short-lived.
Increase the default timeout value by
setting the timeout database option

Two concurrent transactions from different threads on the same process that both attempt to write to the database is more concurrency than sqlite can handle. My answer below has additional detail about this.

The practical reason for this is often that the python or django shells have opened a request to the DB and it wasn't closed properly; killing your terminal access often frees it up.  I had this error on running command line tests today.
Edit:  I get periodic upvotes on this.  If you'd like to kill access without rebooting the terminal, then from commandline you can do:
from django import db
db.connections.close_all()

+1 for the  db.connections.close_all()  tip. I was looking for something that would unlock the database before I shell out to a cleanup script in  tearDown() . This fixed it. Thanks.

In my case, It was because I open the database from SQLite Browser. When I close it from the browser, the problem is gone.

I disagree with @Patrick's answer which, by quoting this doc, implicitly links OP's problem ( Database is locked ) to this:
Switching to another database backend. At a certain point SQLite becomes too ""lite"" for real-world applications, and these sorts of concurrency errors indicate you've reached that point.
This is a bit ""too easy"" to incriminate SQlite for this problem (which is  very powerful  when correctly used; it's not only a toy for small databases, fun fact:  An SQLite database is limited in size to 140 terabytes ).
Unless you have a very busy server with thousands of connections at the same second,  the reason for this  Database is locked  error is probably more a bad use of the API, than a problem inherent to SQlite which would be ""too light"" . Here are more informations about  Implementation Limits for SQLite .
Now the solution:
I had the same problem when I was using two scripts using the same database at the same time:
one was accessing the DB with write operations
the other was accessing the DB in read-only
Solution:  always do  cursor.close()  as soon as possible after having done a (even read-only) query.
Here are more details .

A few hours ago, I agreed with you that it seems too easy to incriminate sqlite for this problem. But now I know that two simultaneous connections that start a transaction that includes a write operation is enough to get ""database is locked"". See my answer for more details.
–  Evan
Sep 6 at 18:18
@evan sqlite has a ""busy timeout"" .   If you set it to nonzero, you will never see this message even if many threads are accessing the db... unless those threads fail to close a transaction.   holding transactions and connections open kills sqlite ""concurrency""

As others have told, there is another process that is using the SQLite file and has not closed the connection. In case you are using Linux, you can see which processes are using the file (for example  db.sqlite3 ) using the  fuser  command as follows:
$ sudo fuser -v db.sqlite3
USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/path/to/db.sqlite3:
user    955 F.... apache2
If you want to stop the processes to release the lock, use  fuser -k  which sends the  KILL  signal to all processes accessing the file:
sudo fuser -k db.sqlite3
Note that this is dangerous as it might stop the web server process in a production server.
Thanks to @cz-game for pointing out  fuser !

I've got the same error! One of the reasons was the DB connection was not closed.
Therefore, check for  unclosed DB connections . Also, check if you have  committed  the DB before closing the connection.

I encountered this error message in a situation that is not (clearly) addressed by the help info linked in patrick's answer.
When I used  transaction.atomic()  to wrap a call to  FooModel.objects.get_or_create()  and called that code simultaneously from two different threads, only one thread would succeed, while the other would get the ""database is locked"" error. Changing the timeout database option had no effect on the behavior.
I think this is due to the fact that sqlite  cannot handle multiple simultaneous writers , so the application must serialize writes on their own.
I solved the problem by using a  threading.RLock  object instead of  transaction.atomic()  when my Django app is running with a sqlite backend. That's not entirely equivalent, so you may need to do something else in your application.
Here's my code that runs  FooModel.objects.get_or_create  simultaneously from two different threads, in case it is helpful:
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import configurations
configurations.setup()
from django.db import transaction
from submissions.models import ExerciseCollectionSubmission
def makeSubmission(user_id):
try:
with transaction.atomic():
e, _ = ExerciseCollectionSubmission.objects.get_or_create(
student_id=user_id, exercise_collection_id=172)
except Exception as e:
return f'failed: {e}'
e.delete()
return 'success'
futures = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
futures.append(executor.submit(makeSubmission, 296))
futures.append(executor.submit(makeSubmission, 297))
for future in futures:
print(future.result())

This also could happen if you are connected to your sqlite db via dbbrowser plugin through pycharm. Disconnection will solve the problem

UPDATE  django version 2.1.7
I got this error  sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked  using  pytest  with  django .
Solution:
If we are using  @pytest.mark.django_db  decorator. What it does is create a  in-memory-db  for testing.
Named:  file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared  We can get this name with:
from django.db import connection
db_path = connection.settings_dict['NAME']
To access this database and also edit it, do:
Connect to the data base:
with sqlite3.connect(db_path, uri=True) as conn:
c = conn.cursor()
Use  uri=True  to specifies the disk file that is the SQLite database to be opened.
To avoid the error activate transactions in the decorator:
@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
Final function:
from django.db import connection
@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_mytest():
db_path = connection.settings_dict['NAME']
with sqlite3.connect(db_path, uri=True) as conn:
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('my amazing query')
conn.commit()
assert ... == ....

Are you saying that in-memory sqlite databases never raise the ""database is locked"" error? This answer is confusing because the original question doesn't involve  pytest  and I don't know what  pytest.mark.django_db  does. The  sqlite docs  don't say that in-memory databases have any different concurrency constraints.

Getting arguments for any callable object?
Ask Question

I am interested in obtaining a general way to obtain a list of arguments and keyword arguments taken by a callable Python object. This is straight-forward for functions with the  inspect.getargspec  function, for example:
import inspect
from functools import partial
def foo(*args, **kwargs):
return args, kwargs
print(inspect.getargspec(foo))
>>ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords='kwargs', defaults=None)
def bar(*args):
return args
print(inspect.getargspec(bar))
>>ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords=None, defaults=None)
However, this fails in cases such as these:
partial_function = partial(foo, kwarg=""value"")
inspect.getargspec(partial_function)
>>TypeError: <functools.partial object at 0x11748bc58> is not a Python function
class Foo(object):
def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
return args, kwargs
foo_instance = Foo()
inspect.getargspec(foo_instance)
>>TypeError: <__main__.Foo object at 0x116c13ed0> is not a Python function
inspect.getargspec(zip)
>>TypeError: <built-in function zip> is not a Python function
Note, that there are ways to obtain the arguments for the partial function and for the callable object, i.e:
inspect.getargspec(partial_function.func)
>>ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords='kwargs', defaults=None)
inspect.getargspec(foo_instance.__call__)
>>ArgSpec(args=['self'], varargs='args', keywords='kwargs', defaults=None)
but I would like a more general way of obtaining these results, if at all possible.

All these can be handled by using the  inspect.signature  helper function which, as stated in its docs:
Accepts a wide range of python callables, from plain functions and classes to  functools.partial()  objects.
What  signature  does is it takes your callable and constructs a  Signature  object from it:
>>> from inspect import signature
>>> s = signature(Foo())  # class as shown in your example
with the arguments now lying in the  parameters  mapping attribute for the  Signature  instance:
>>> s.parameters
mappingproxy({'args': <Parameter ""*args"">, 'kwargs': <Parameter ""**kwargs"">})
With a  partial  object, you'd get the corresponding representation:
>>> def foo(a, b, c): pass
>>> p = partial(foo, c = 30)
>>> signature(p).parameters
<Signature (a, b, *, c=20)>
As for built-in functions such as  zip , this isn't always possible, some of these functions don't expose the appropriate metadata to construct a signature,  from  PEP 362 :
Some functions may not be introspectable in certain implementations of Python. For example, in CPython, built-in functions defined in  C  provide no metadata about their arguments. Adding support for them is out of scope for this PEP.
So, while  zip  isn't the type to expose information about itself, others are, e.g  all :
>>> signature(all)
<Signature (iterable, /)>
you'll unfortunately require a  try-except  for these, there's nothing else that can be done.
The cases that the  signature  helper handles are enumerated in the  implementation section of  PEP 362  which introduced it.
In general,  inspect.getargspec  has been deprecated for a while now in Python 3, the suggested approach (if you're using Python 3, that is) is to use  the representation offered via  Signature  objects.
If on Python  2 , I'm pretty sure you can't do it directly with  getargspec , you should use  getfullargspec  as Anttis' answer suggests.

getfullargspec  also handles partials correctly. It was previously deprecated but was  undeprecated  since it was deemed that it is quite useful for single-source Python 2/3 polyglot code.
Another option is  signature  which is a bit more complicated.

This guide is to help you install FreeRADIUS and Daloradius on Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 16.04 LTS servers. Our recent guide on FreeRADIUS was for how to  Install FreeRADIUS and Daloradius on CentOS 7 and RHEL 7 . FreeRADIUS is an open source, high-performance, modular, scalable and feature-rich RADIUS server. It ships with both server and radius client, development libraries and numerous additional RADIUS related utilities.
FreeRADIUS supports request proxying, with fail-over and load balancing, as well as the ability to access many types of back-end databases.
RADIUS, which stands for “ Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service “, is a network protocol used for remote user authentication and accounting. It provides AAA services; namely  Authorization ,  Authentication , and  Accounting .
Features of FreeRADIUS
Flexible Configuration through a wide range of methods to select user configurations. Complete support for RFC 2865 and RFC 2866 attributes. EAP with EAP-MD5, EAP-SIM, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, and Cisco LEAP EAP sub-types Vendor Specific Attributes for almost one hundred vendors, including BinTec, Foundry, Cisco, Juniper, Lucent/Ascend, HP ProCurve, Microsoft, USR/3Com, Acc/Newbridge and many more.
What is daloRADIUS?
On the other side, daloRADIUS is an advanced RADIUS web management platform written in PHP and JavaScript. It is mainly aimed at managing Hotspots and general-purpose ISP deployments powered by FreeRADIUS server. Some good features of daloRADIUS include:
Has a database abstraction layer with support for many database systems – MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MsSQL and Oracle Advanced user management Powerful graphical reporting and accounting Integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-location Has a  billing engine
How to install FreeRADIUS and Daloradius on Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 16.04
Start by updating your system packages to the latest version:
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
Reboot system after doing an upgrade
sudo reboot
Once the system is up, begin the installation FreeRADIUS and Daloradius on your Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 16.04 system.
Step 1: Install Apache Web Server and PHP
Daloradius will require php and Apache web server to be installed on the host system.
Installing Apache on Ubuntu:
Install Apache web server by running:
sudo apt -y install apache2
For installation of PHP on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 16.04, run:
sudo apt -y install php libapache2-mod-php php-{gd,common,mail,mail-mime,mysql,pear,db,mbstring,xml,curl}
Check the version of php installed:
$  php -v
PHP 7.2.19-0ubuntu0.18.04.2 (cli) (built: Aug 12 2019 19:34:28) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
with Zend OPcache v7.2.19-0ubuntu0.18.04.2, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
Step 2: Install MariaDB and Create a database
Next is to install the MariaDB server and create a database for daloRADIUS. We have a comprehensive guide for installing MariaDB 10.x on Ubuntu
Install MariaDB 10.x on Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7
Once installed and running, create a database for FreeRADIUS, this will be used at a later stage.
database name:  radius
database user:  radius
database user password:  radiuspassword
If you have a dedicated database server, replace  localhost  with the IP of source FreeRADIUS Server.
$  mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE radius;
GRANT ALL ON radius.* TO  [email protected]  IDENTIFIED BY ""radiuspassword"";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit
Step 3: Install and Configure FreeRADIUS
As of this writing, the default version of FreeRADIUS installed on Ubuntu 18.04 is  v3.0.  Install if from official Ubuntu apt repository using:
sudo apt -y install freeradius freeradius-mysql freeradius-utils
Among the packages installed are  mysql  module and  utils  package.
For Ubuntu 16.04 system, version 2.x is the package available from the official repository. To install version  3.0,  add the Personal Package Archive (PPA) for the version 3 of FreeRADIUS.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freeradius/stable-3.0
sudo apt-get update
Install the following FreeRADIUS packages.
sudo apt-get install freeradius freeradius-mysql freeradius-utils
Import the freeradius MySQL database scheme:
sudo su -
mysql -u root -p radius < /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-config/sql/main/mysql/schema.sql
Check tables created:
$  mysql -u root -p -e ""use radius;show tables;""
Enter password:
+------------------+
| Tables_in_radius |
+------------------+
| nas              |
| radacct          |
| radcheck         |
| radgroupcheck    |
| radgroupreply    |
| radpostauth      |
| radreply         |
| radusergroup     |
+------------------+
Create a soft link for sql module under  /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/sql /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/
Configure SQL module and change the database connection parameters to suit your environment.
sudo vim /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/sql
Your sql section should look similar to below.
sql {
driver = "" rlm_sql_mysql ""
dialect = "" mysql ""
# Connection info:
server = ""localhost""
port = 3306
login = "" radius ""
password = "" radiuspassword ""
# Database table configuration for everything except Oracle
radius_db = ""radius""
}
# Set to ‘yes’ to read radius clients from the database (‘nas’ table)
# Clients will ONLY be read on server startup.
read_clients = yes
# Table to keep radius client info
client_table = ""nas""
Then change group right of  /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/sql
sudo chgrp -h freerad /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/sql
sudo chown -R freerad:freerad /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/sql
Restart freeradius service:
sudo systemctl restart freeradius.service
Install and Configure Daloradius on Ubuntu 18.04 / 16.04
We need to install Daloradius to get FreeRADIUS web administration interface.
wget  https://github.com/lirantal/daloradius/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv daloradius-master daloradius
Change directory for configuration
cd daloradius
Configuring daloradius
Now import Daloradius mysql tables
mysql -u root -p radius < contrib/db/fr2-mysql-daloradius-and-freeradius.sql
mysql -u root -p radius < contrib/db/mysql-daloradius.sql
Configure daloRADIUS database connection details:
cd ..
sudo mv daloradius /var/www/html/
Then change permissions for http folder and set the right permissions for the daloradius configuration file.
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/daloradius/
sudo chmod 664 /var/www/html/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf.php
You should now modify the file daloradius.conf.php  to adjust the MySQL database information. Open the  daloradius.conf.php  and add the database username, password and db name.
sudo vim /var/www/html/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf.php
Especially relevant variables to configure are:
$configValues['CONFIG_DB_HOST'] = 'localhost';
$configValues['CONFIG_DB_PORT'] = '3306';
$configValues['CONFIG_DB_USER'] = ' radius ';
$configValues['CONFIG_DB_PASS'] = ' radiuspassword ';
$configValues['CONFIG_DB_NAME'] = ' radius ';
To be sure everything works, restart  freeradius and apache2
sudo systemctl restart freeradius.service apache2
Open Admin link using your system IP address or domain name:
http://ip-address/daloradius/login.php
A page like this will appear:
Default login details are:
Username:  administrator
Password:  radius
Change the password after first login.

Introduction
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising
the standard library in the main Python distribution.  Please see the
companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code
in the C implementation of Python  [1] .
This document and  PEP 257  (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from
Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from
Barry's style guide  [2] .
This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are
identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in
the language itself.
Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any
conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project.
A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds
One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than
it is written.  The guidelines provided here are intended to improve
the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide
spectrum of Python code.  As  PEP 20  says, ""Readability counts"".
A style guide is about consistency.  Consistency with this style guide
is important.  Consistency within a project is more important.
Consistency within one module or function is the most important.
However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide
recommendations just aren't applicable.  When in doubt, use your best
judgment.  Look at other examples and decide what looks best.  And
don't hesitate to ask!
In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with
this PEP!
Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:
When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even
for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe
for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to
clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).
Because the code in question predates the introduction of the
guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of
Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.
Code Lay-out
Indentation
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and
braces, or using a  hanging indent   [7] .  When using a hanging
indent the following should be considered; there should be no
arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to
clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.
Yes:
# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
var_one, var_two, var_three,
var_four):
print(var_one)
# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
No:
# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
var_one, var_two, var_three,
var_four):
print(var_one)
The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines.
Optional:
# Hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces.
foo = long_function_name(
var_one, var_two,
var_three, var_four)
When the conditional part of an  if -statement is long enough to require
that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the
combination of a two character keyword (i.e.  if ), plus a single space,
plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the
subsequent lines of the multiline conditional.  This can produce a visual
conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the  if -statement,
which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces.  This PEP takes no
explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such
conditional lines from the nested suite inside the  if -statement.
Acceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to:
# No extra indentation.
if (this_is_one_thing and
that_is_another_thing):
do_something()
# Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors
# supporting syntax highlighting.
if (this_is_one_thing and
that_is_another_thing):
# Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
do_something()
# Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line.
if (this_is_one_thing
and that_is_another_thing):
do_something()
(Also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary
operators below.)
The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may
either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last
line of list, as in:
my_list = [
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
'a', 'b', 'c',
'd', 'e', 'f',
)
or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that
starts the multiline construct, as in:
my_list = [
1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
'a', 'b', 'c',
'd', 'e', 'f',
)
Tabs or Spaces?
Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is
already indented with tabs.
Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.
Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be
converted to using spaces exclusively.
When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with
the  -t  option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes
tabs and spaces.  When using  -tt  these warnings become errors.
These options are highly recommended!
Maximum Line Length
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions
(docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72
characters.
Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have
several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code
review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.
The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the
code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to
avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even
if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping
lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all.
Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length.  For code maintained
exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this
issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters,
provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72
characters.
The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting
lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72).
The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied
line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  Long lines
can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in
parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash
for line continuation.
Backslashes may still be appropriate at times.  For example, long,
multiple  with -statements cannot use implicit continuation, so
backslashes are acceptable:
with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
file_2.write(file_1.read())
(See the previous discussion on  multiline if-statements  for further
thoughts on the indentation of such multiline  with -statements.)
Another such case is with  assert  statements.
Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately.
Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?
For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.
But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get
scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is
moved away from its operand and onto the previous line.  Here, the eye
has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are
subtracted:
# No: operators sit far away from their operands
income = (gross_wages +
taxable_interest +
(dividends - qualified_dividends) -
ira_deduction -
student_loan_interest)
To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers
follow the opposite convention.  Donald Knuth explains the traditional
rule in his  Computers and Typesetting  series: ""Although formulas
within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations,
displayed formulas always break before binary operations""  [3] .
Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more
readable code:
# Yes: easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
+ taxable_interest
+ (dividends - qualified_dividends)
- ira_deduction
- student_loan_interest)
In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary
operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally.  For new
code Knuth's style is suggested.
Blank Lines
Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank
lines.
Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank
line.
Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
related functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).
Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
Python accepts the control-L (i.e. ^L) form feed character as
whitespace; Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so
you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.
Note, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize
control-L as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place.
Source File Encoding
Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8 (or ASCII
in Python 2).
Files using ASCII (in Python 2) or UTF-8 (in Python 3) should not have
an encoding declaration.
In the standard library, non-default encodings should be used only for
test purposes or when a comment or docstring needs to mention an author
name that contains non-ASCII characters; otherwise, using  \x ,
\u ,  \U , or  \N  escapes is the preferred way to include
non-ASCII data in string literals.
For Python 3.0 and beyond, the following policy is prescribed for the
standard library (see  PEP 3131 ): All identifiers in the Python
standard library MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use
English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and
technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string
literals and comments must also be in ASCII. The only exceptions are
(a) test cases testing the non-ASCII features, and
(b) names of authors. Authors whose names are not based on the
Latin alphabet (latin-1, ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set) MUST provide
a transliteration of their names in this character set.
Open source projects with a global audience are encouraged to adopt a
similar policy.
Imports
Imports should usually be on separate lines:
Yes: import os
import sys
No:  import sys, os
It's okay to say this though:
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module
comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
Imports should be grouped in the following order:
Standard library imports.
Related third party imports.
Local application/library specific imports.
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.
Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable
and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error
messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as
when a directory inside a package ends up on  sys.path ):
import mypkg.sibling
from mypkg import sibling
from mypkg.sibling import example
However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to
absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts
where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose:
from . import sibling
from .sibling import example
Standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always
use absolute imports.
Implicit relative imports should  never  be used and have been removed
in Python 3.
When importing a class from a class-containing module, it's usually
okay to spell this:
from myclass import MyClass
from foo.bar.yourclass import YourClass
If this spelling causes local name clashes, then spell them explicitly:
import myclass
import foo.bar.yourclass
and use ""myclass.MyClass"" and ""foo.bar.yourclass.YourClass"".
Wildcard imports ( from <module> import * ) should be avoided, as
they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace,
confusing both readers and many automated tools. There is one
defensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an
internal interface as part of a public API (for example, overwriting
a pure Python implementation of an interface with the definitions
from an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions
will be overwritten isn't known in advance).
When republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding
public and internal interfaces still apply.
Module Level Dunder Names
Module level ""dunders"" (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing
underscores) such as  __all__ ,  __author__ ,  __version__ ,
etc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import
statements  except   from __future__  imports.  Python mandates that
future-imports must appear in the module before any other code except
docstrings:
""""""This is the example module.
This module does stuff.
""""""
from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL
__all__ = ['a', 'b', 'c']
__version__ = '0.1'
__author__ = 'Cardinal Biggles'
import os
import sys
String Quotes
In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the
same.  This PEP does not make a recommendation for this.  Pick a rule
and stick to it.  When a string contains single or double quote
characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the
string. It improves readability.
For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be
consistent with the docstring convention in  PEP 257 .
Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
Pet Peeves
Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis.
Yes: foo = (0,)
No:  bar = (0, )
Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:
Yes: if x == 4: print x, y; x, y = y, x
No:  if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x
However, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and
should have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the
operator with the lowest priority).  In an extended slice, both
colons must have the same amount of spacing applied.  Exception:
when a slice parameter is omitted, the space is omitted.
Yes:
ham[1:9], ham[1:9:3], ham[:9:3], ham[1::3], ham[1:9:]
ham[lower:upper], ham[lower:upper:], ham[lower::step]
ham[lower+offset : upper+offset]
ham[: upper_fn(x) : step_fn(x)], ham[:: step_fn(x)]
ham[lower + offset : upper + offset]
No:
ham[lower + offset:upper + offset]
ham[1: 9], ham[1 :9], ham[1:9 :3]
ham[lower : : upper]
ham[ : upper]
Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument
list of a function call:
Yes: spam(1)
No:  spam (1)
Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or
slicing:
Yes: dct['key'] = lst[index]
No:  dct ['key'] = lst [index]
More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to
align it with another.
Yes:
x = 1
y = 2
long_variable = 3
No:
x             = 1
y             = 2
long_variable = 3
Other Recommendations
Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere.  Because it's usually invisible,
it can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a
newline does not count as a line continuation marker.  Some editors
don't preserve it and many projects (like CPython itself) have
pre-commit hooks that reject it.
Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either
side: assignment ( = ), augmented assignment ( += ,  -=
etc.), comparisons ( == ,  < ,  > ,  != ,  <> ,  <= ,
>= ,  in ,  not in ,  is ,  is not ), Booleans ( and ,
or ,  not ).
If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use
your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and
always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary
operator.
Yes:
i = i + 1
submitted += 1
x = x*2 - 1
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
c = (a+b) * (a-b)
No:
i=i+1
submitted +=1
x = x * 2 - 1
hypot2 = x * x + y * y
c = (a + b) * (a - b)
Function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and
always have spaces around the  ->  arrow if present.  (See
Function Annotations  below for more about function annotations.)
Yes:
def munge(input: AnyStr): ...
def munge() -> PosInt: ...
No:
def munge(input:AnyStr): ...
def munge()->PosInt: ...
Don't use spaces around the  =  sign when used to indicate a
keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an
unannotated  function parameter.
Yes:
def complex(real, imag=0.0):
return magic(r=real, i=imag)
No:
def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
return magic(r = real, i = imag)
When combining an argument annotation with a default value, however, do use
spaces around the  =  sign:
Yes:
def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, sep: AnyStr = None, limit=1000): ...
No:
def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, limit = 1000): ...
Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are
generally discouraged.
Yes:
if foo == 'blah':
do_blah_thing()
do_one()
do_two()
do_three()
Rather not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
While sometimes it's okay to put an if/for/while with a small body
on the same line, never do this for multi-clause statements.  Also
avoid folding such long lines!
Rather not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
for x in lst: total += x
while t < 10: t = delay()
Definitely not:
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
else: do_non_blah_thing()
try: something()
finally: cleanup()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three(long, argument,
list, like, this)
if foo == 'blah': one(); two(); three()
When to Use Trailing Commas
Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when
making a tuple of one element (and in Python 2 they have semantics for
the  print  statement).  For clarity, it is recommended to surround
the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses.
Yes:
FILES = ('setup.cfg',)
OK, but confusing:
FILES = 'setup.cfg',
When trailing commas are redundant, they are often helpful when a
version control system is used, when a list of values, arguments or
imported items is expected to be extended over time.  The pattern is
to put each value (etc.) on a line by itself, always adding a trailing
comma, and add the close parenthesis/bracket/brace on the next line.
However it does not make sense to have a trailing comma on the same
line as the closing delimiter (except in the above case of singleton
tuples).
Yes:
FILES = [
'setup.cfg',
'tox.ini',
]
initialize(FILES,
error=True,
)
No:
FILES = ['setup.cfg', 'tox.ini',]
initialize(FILES, error=True,)
Comments
Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.  Always
make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code
changes!
Comments should be complete sentences.  The first word should be
capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case
letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).
Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of
complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.
You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi-
sentence comments, except after the final sentence.
When writing English, follow Strunk and White.
Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your
comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never
be read by people who don't speak your language.
Block Comments
Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows
them, and are indented to the same level as that code.  Each line of a
block comment starts with a  #  and a single space (unless it is
indented text inside the comment).
Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a
single  # .
Inline Comments
Use inline comments sparingly.
An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.
Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the
statement.  They should start with a # and a single space.
Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state
the obvious.  Don't do this:
x = x + 1                 # Increment x
But sometimes, this is useful:
x = x + 1                 # Compensate for border
Documentation Strings
Conventions for writing good documentation strings
(a.k.a. ""docstrings"") are immortalized in  PEP 257 .
Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and
methods.  Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but
you should have a comment that describes what the method does.  This
comment should appear after the  def  line.
PEP 257  describes good docstring conventions.  Note that most
importantly, the  """"""  that ends a multiline docstring should be
on a line by itself:
""""""Return a foobang
Optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first.
""""""
For one liner docstrings, please keep the closing  """"""  on
the same line.
Naming Conventions
The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so
we'll never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are
the currently recommended naming standards.  New modules and packages
(including third party frameworks) should be written to these
standards, but where an existing library has a different style,
internal consistency is preferred.
Overriding Principle
Names that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should
follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.
Descriptive: Naming Styles
There are a lot of different naming styles.  It helps to be able to
recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what
they are used for.
The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:
b  (single lowercase letter)
B  (single uppercase letter)
lowercase
lower_case_with_underscores
UPPERCASE
UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
CapitalizedWords  (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because
of the bumpy look of its letters  [4] ).  This is also sometimes known
as StudlyCaps.
Note: When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the
letters of the acronym.  Thus HTTPServerError is better than
HttpServerError.
mixedCase  (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase
character!)
Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores  (ugly!)
There's also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related
names together.  This is not used much in Python, but it is mentioned
for completeness.  For example, the  os.stat()  function returns a
tuple whose items traditionally have names like  st_mode ,
st_size ,  st_mtime  and so on.  (This is done to emphasize the
correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which
helps programmers familiar with that.)
The X11 library uses a leading X for all its public functions.  In
Python, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute
and method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are
prefixed with a module name.
In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing
underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any
case convention):
_single_leading_underscore : weak ""internal use"" indicator.
E.g.  from M import *  does not import objects whose names start
with an underscore.
single_trailing_underscore_ : used by convention to avoid
conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.
Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')
__double_leading_underscore : when naming a class attribute,
invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar,  __boo  becomes
_FooBar__boo ; see below).
__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ : ""magic"" objects or
attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces.
E.g.  __init__ ,  __import__  or  __file__ .  Never invent
such names; only use them as documented.
Prescriptive: Naming Conventions
Names to Avoid
Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase
letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable
names.
In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the
numerals one and zero.  When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.
ASCII Compatibility
Identifiers used in the standard library must be ASCII compatible
as described in the
policy section
of  PEP 3131 .
Package and Module Names
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names.  Underscores can be
used in the module name if it improves readability.  Python packages
should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of
underscores is discouraged.
When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying
Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented)
interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore
(e.g.  _socket ).
Class Names
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where
the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.
Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin
names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords
convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.
Type Variable Names
Names of type variables introduced in  PEP 484  should normally use CapWords
preferring short names:  T ,  AnyStr ,  Num . It is recommended to add
suffixes  _co  or  _contra  to the variables used to declare covariant
or contravariant behavior correspondingly:
from typing import TypeVar
VT_co = TypeVar('VT_co', covariant=True)
KT_contra = TypeVar('KT_contra', contravariant=True)
Exception Names
Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention
applies here.  However, you should use the suffix ""Error"" on your
exception names (if the exception actually is an error).
Global Variable Names
(Let's hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module
only.)  The conventions are about the same as those for functions.
Modules that are designed for use via  from M import *  should use
the  __all__  mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the
older convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which
you might want to do to indicate these globals are ""module
non-public"").
Function and Variable Names
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by
underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the
prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards
compatibility.
Function and Method Arguments
Always use  self  for the first argument to instance methods.
Always use  cls  for the first argument to class methods.
If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is
generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than
use an abbreviation or spelling corruption.  Thus  class_  is better
than  clss .  (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a
synonym.)
Method Names and Instance Variables
Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by
underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance
variables.
To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to
invoke Python's name mangling rules.
Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an
attribute named  __a , it cannot be accessed by  Foo.__a .  (An
insistent user could still gain access by calling  Foo._Foo__a .)
Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid
name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.
Note: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see below).
Constants
Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all
capital letters with underscores separating words.  Examples include
MAX_OVERFLOW  and  TOTAL .
Designing for Inheritance
Always decide whether a class's methods and instance variables
(collectively: ""attributes"") should be public or non-public.  If in
doubt, choose non-public; it's easier to make it public later than to
make a public attribute non-public.
Public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your
class to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible
changes.  Non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be
used by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public
attributes won't change or even be removed.
We don't use the term ""private"" here, since no attribute is really
private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work).
Another category of attributes are those that are part of the
""subclass API"" (often called ""protected"" in other languages).  Some
classes are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify
aspects of the class's behavior.  When designing such a class, take
care to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public,
which are part of the subclass API, and which are truly only to be
used by your base class.
With this in mind, here are the Pythonic guidelines:
Public attributes should have no leading underscores.
If your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword,
append a single trailing underscore to your attribute name.  This is
preferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling.  (However,
notwithstanding this rule, 'cls' is the preferred spelling for any
variable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the
first argument to a class method.)
Note 1: See the argument name recommendation above for class methods.
For simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the
attribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods.  Keep
in mind that Python provides an easy path to future enhancement,
should you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow
functional behavior.  In that case, use properties to hide
functional implementation behind simple data attribute access
syntax.
Note 1: Properties only work on new-style classes.
Note 2: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free,
although side-effects such as caching are generally fine.
Note 3: Avoid using properties for computationally expensive
operations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that
access is (relatively) cheap.
If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes
that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with
double leading underscores and no trailing underscores.  This
invokes Python's name mangling algorithm, where the name of the
class is mangled into the attribute name.  This helps avoid
attribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain
attributes with the same name.
Note 1: Note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled
name, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute
name, you can still get name collisions.
Note 2: Name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and
__getattr__() , less convenient.  However the name mangling
algorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually.
Note 3: Not everyone likes name mangling.  Try to balance the
need to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by
advanced callers.
Public and Internal Interfaces
Any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces.
Accordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish
between public and internal interfaces.
Documented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation
explicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt
from the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. All undocumented
interfaces should be assumed to be internal.
To better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the
names in their public API using the  __all__  attribute. Setting
__all__  to an empty list indicates that the module has no public API.
Even with  __all__  set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages,
modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be
prefixed with a single leading underscore.
An interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace
(package, module or class) is considered internal.
Imported names should always be considered an implementation detail.
Other modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names
unless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module's
API, such as  os.path  or a package's  __init__  module that exposes
functionality from submodules.
Programming Recommendations
Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other
implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython, Cython, Psyco,
and such).
For example, do not rely on CPython's efficient implementation of
in-place string concatenation for statements in the form  a += b
or  a = a + b .  This optimization is fragile even in CPython (it
only works for some types) and isn't present at all in implementations
that don't use refcounting.  In performance sensitive parts of the
library, the  ''.join()  form should be used instead.  This will
ensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various
implementations.
Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with
is  or  is not , never the equality operators.
Also, beware of writing  if x  when you really mean  if x is not
None  -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that
defaults to None was set to some other value.  The other value might
have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean
context!
Use  is not  operator rather than  not ... is .  While both
expressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable
and preferred.
Yes:
if foo is not None:
No:
if not foo is None:
When implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is
best to implement all six operations ( __eq__ ,  __ne__ ,
__lt__ ,  __le__ ,  __gt__ ,  __ge__ ) rather than relying
on other code to only exercise a particular comparison.
To minimize the effort involved, the  functools.total_ordering()
decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods.
PEP 207  indicates that reflexivity rules  are  assumed by Python.
Thus, the interpreter may swap  y > x  with  x < y ,  y >= x
with  x <= y , and may swap the arguments of  x == y  and  x !=
y .  The  sort()  and  min()  operations are guaranteed to use
the  <  operator and the  max()  function uses the  >
operator.  However, it is best to implement all six operations so
that confusion doesn't arise in other contexts.
Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds
a lambda expression directly to an identifier.
Yes:
def f(x): return 2*x
No:
f = lambda x: 2*x
The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is
specifically 'f' instead of the generic '<lambda>'. This is more
useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use
of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda
expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can
be embedded inside a larger expression)
Derive exceptions from  Exception  rather than  BaseException .
Direct inheritance from  BaseException  is reserved for exceptions
where catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do.
Design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code
catching  the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations
where the exceptions are raised. Aim to answer the question
""What went wrong?"" programmatically, rather than only stating that
""A problem occurred"" (see  PEP 3151  for an example of this lesson being
learned for the builtin exception hierarchy)
Class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the
suffix ""Error"" to your exception classes if the exception is an
error.  Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control
or other forms of signaling need no special suffix.
Use exception chaining appropriately. In Python 3, ""raise X from Y""
should be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the
original traceback.
When deliberately replacing an inner exception (using ""raise X"" in
Python 2 or ""raise X from None"" in Python 3.3+), ensure that relevant
details are transferred to the new exception (such as preserving the
attribute name when converting KeyError to AttributeError, or
embedding the text of the original exception in the new exception
message).
When raising an exception in Python 2, use  raise  ValueError('message')
instead of the older form  raise ValueError, 'message' .
The latter form is not legal Python 3 syntax.
The paren-using form also means that when the exception arguments are
long or include string formatting, you don't need to use line
continuation characters thanks to the containing parentheses.
When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever
possible instead of using a bare  except:  clause:
try:
import platform_specific_module
except ImportError:
platform_specific_module = None
A bare  except:  clause will catch SystemExit and
KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a
program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems.  If you
want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use
except Exception:  (bare except is equivalent to  except
BaseException: ).
A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare 'except' clauses to two
cases:
If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the
traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has
occurred.
If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the
exception propagate upwards with  raise .   try...finally
can be a better way to handle this case.
When binding caught exceptions to a name, prefer the explicit name
binding syntax added in Python 2.6:
try:
process_data()
except Exception as exc:
raise DataProcessingFailedError(str(exc))
This is the only syntax supported in Python 3, and avoids the
ambiguity problems associated with the older comma-based syntax.
When catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception
hierarchy introduced in Python 3.3 over introspection of  errno
values.
Additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the  try  clause
to the absolute minimum amount of code necessary.  Again, this
avoids masking bugs.
Yes:
try:
value = collection[key]
except KeyError:
return key_not_found(key)
else:
return handle_value(value)
No:
try:
# Too broad!
return handle_value(collection[key])
except KeyError:
# Will also catch KeyError raised by handle_value()
return key_not_found(key)
When a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a
with  statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably
after use. A try/finally statement is also acceptable.
Context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods
whenever they do something other than acquire and release resources.
Yes:
with conn.begin_transaction():
do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
No:
with conn:
do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
The latter example doesn't provide any information to indicate that
the  __enter__  and  __exit__  methods are doing something other
than closing the connection after a transaction.  Being explicit is
important in this case.
Be consistent in return statements.  Either all return statements in
a function should return an expression, or none of them should.  If
any return statement returns an expression, any return statements
where no value is returned should explicitly state this as  return
None , and an explicit return statement should be present at the
end of the function (if reachable).
Yes:
def foo(x):
if x >= 0:
return math.sqrt(x)
else:
return None
def bar(x):
if x < 0:
return None
return math.sqrt(x)
No:
def foo(x):
if x >= 0:
return math.sqrt(x)
def bar(x):
if x < 0:
return
return math.sqrt(x)
Use string methods instead of the string module.
String methods are always much faster and share the same API with
unicode strings.  Override this rule if backwards compatibility with
Pythons older than 2.0 is required.
Use  ''.startswith()  and  ''.endswith()  instead of string
slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes.
startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone:
Yes: if foo.startswith('bar'):
No:  if foo[:3] == 'bar':
Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of
comparing types directly.
Yes: if isinstance(obj, int):
No:  if type(obj) is type(1):
When checking if an object is a string, keep in mind that it might
be a unicode string too!  In Python 2, str and unicode have a
common base class, basestring, so you can do:
if isinstance(obj, basestring):
Note that in Python 3,  unicode  and  basestring  no longer exist
(there is only  str ) and a bytes object is no longer a kind of
string (it is a sequence of integers instead).
For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty
sequences are false.
Yes: if not seq:
if seq:
No:  if len(seq):
if not len(seq):
Don't write string literals that rely on significant trailing
whitespace.  Such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable
and some editors (or more recently, reindent.py) will trim them.
Don't compare boolean values to True or False using  == .
Yes:   if greeting:
No:    if greeting == True:
Worse: if greeting is True:
Use of the flow control statements  return / break / continue
within the finally suite of a  try...finally , where the flow control
statement would jump outside the finally suite, is discouraged.  This
is because such statements will implicitly cancel any active exception
that is propagating through the finally suite.
No:
def foo():
try:
1 / 0
finally:
return 42
Function Annotations
With the acceptance of  PEP 484 , the style rules for function
annotations are changing.
In order to be forward compatible, function annotations in Python 3
code should preferably use  PEP 484  syntax.  (There are some
formatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section.)
The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended
previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged.
However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of  PEP 484
are now encouraged.  For example, marking up a large third party
library or application with  PEP 484  style type annotations,
reviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing
whether their presence increases code understandability.
The Python standard library should be conservative in adopting such
annotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big
refactorings.
For code that wants to make a different use of function annotations
it is recommended to put a comment of the form:
# type: ignore
near the top of the file; this tells type checker to ignore all
annotations.  (More fine-grained ways of disabling complaints from
type checkers can be found in  PEP 484 .)
Like linters, type checkers are optional, separate tools.  Python
interpreters by default should not issue any messages due to type
checking and should not alter their behavior based on annotations.
Users who don't want to use type checkers are free to ignore them.
However, it is expected that users of third party library packages
may want to run type checkers over those packages.  For this purpose
PEP 484  recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read
by the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files.
Stub files can be distributed with a library, or separately (with
the library author's permission) through the typeshed repo  [5] .
For code that needs to be backwards compatible, type annotations
can be added in the form of comments.  See the relevant section of
PEP 484   [6] .
Variable Annotations
PEP 526  introduced variable annotations. The style recommendations for them are
similar to those on function annotations described above:
Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables,
and local variables should have a single space after the colon.
There should be no space before the colon.
If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have
exactly one space on both sides.
Yes:
code: int
class Point:
coords: Tuple[int, int]
label: str = '<unknown>'
No:
code:int  # No space after colon
code : int  # Space before colon
class Test:
result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign
Although the  PEP 526  is accepted for Python 3.6, the variable annotation
syntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of Python
(see  PEP 484  for details).
Footnotes
[7] Hanging indentation  is a type-setting style where all
the lines in a paragraph are indented except the first line.  In
the context of Python, the term is used to describe a style where
the opening parenthesis of a parenthesized statement is the last
non-whitespace character of the line, with subsequent lines being
indented until the closing parenthesis.

The CentOS Project
The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused on delivering a robust open source ecosystem around a Linux platform.
We offer two Linux distros:
– CentOS Linux is a consistent, manageable platform that suits a wide variety of deployments. For some open source communities, it is a solid, predictable base to build upon.
– The new CentOS Stream is a rolling-release distro that tracks just ahead of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development, positioned as a midstream between Fedora Linux and RHEL. For anyone interested in participating and collaborating in the RHEL ecosystem, CentOS Stream is your reliable platform for innovation.
Get CentOS Now
In support of this community effort, the CentOS Project provides extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain code on these platforms.
For more information about updates and improvements in CentOS Stream and CentOS Linux 8, please check out the  CentOS Stream release notes  and the  CentOS linux release notes  or the release announcement in the mailing list archive. Information about other actively maintained CentOS Linux releases is available on the  CentOS Linux 7  and  CentOS Linux 6  release notes pages.

Python – How to list all files in a directory?
By  mkyong  |  December 24, 2018  | Viewed : 227,168 |  +6,405 pv/w
In Python, we can use  os.walker  or  glob  to create a  find()  like function to search or list files or folders in a specified directory and also it’s subdirectories.
1. os.walker
1.1 List all  .txt  files in a specified directory + subdirectories.
import os
path = 'c:\\projects\\hc2\\'
files = []
# r=root, d=directories, f = files
for r, d, f in os.walk(path):
for file in f:
if '.txt' in file:
files.append(os.path.join(r, file))
for f in files:
print(f)
Output
c:\projects\hc2\app\readme.txt
c:\projects\hc2\app\release.txt
c:\projects\hc2\web\readme.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\afrinic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\apnic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\arin.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\lacnic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\ripe.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\out\test\resources\asn\afrinic\3068.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\out\test\resources\asn\afrinic\37018.txt
//...
1.2 List all directories in a specified directory + subdirectories.
import os
path = 'c:\\projects\\hc2\\'
folders = []
# r=root, d=directories, f = files
for r, d, f in os.walk(path):
for folder in d:
folders.append(os.path.join(r, folder))
for f in folders:
print(f)
Output
c:\projects\hc2\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\classes\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\classes\com\
//...
2. glob
Changed in version 3.5: Support for recursive globs using **.
2.1 List all  .txt  files in a specified directory + subdirectories (**).
import glob
path = 'c:\\projects\\hc2\\'
files = [f for f in glob.glob(path + ""**/*.txt"", recursive=True)]
for f in files:
print(f)
Output
c:\projects\hc2\app\readme.txt
c:\projects\hc2\app\release.txt
c:\projects\hc2\web\readme.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\afrinic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\apnic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\arin.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\lacnic.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\download\ripe.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\out\test\resources\asn\afrinic\3068.txt
c:\projects\hc2\whois\out\test\resources\asn\afrinic\37018.txt
//...
2.2 List all directories in a specified directory + subdirectories (**).
import glob
folders = [f for f in glob.glob(path + ""**/"", recursive=True)]
for f in folders:
print(f)
Output
c:\projects\hc2\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\classes\
c:\projects\hc2\analyzer\out\production\classes\com\
//...

ASA 5505 vlan's routing & access-list
Hello, You have set up the ASA interface as a trunk link. So now all you need to do is to create an acl on the inside interface like this: -access-list test deny ip host 192.168.1.5 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 -access-list test permit ip any any acess-group test in interface inside That should do it. Regards, Please rate if post was helpful! Julio

You setup is configurable. It is not fair you expect the whole configurations from Cisco Support community users, who are doing it for labor of love. Even if someone gives you a whole confirmation, it does not end there but you need to maintain and change configuration time and time again.  I would recommend you, if you do not want to bother with configuration technical nitty-gritty on ASA5505 firewall, just get a layer3 switch and enable NAT on the firewall and make your life easy for you.

Hello, Adding to what  rizwanr74  has said ( 100 % true) the configuration is not that hard, you just need to configure the link to the ASA to the switch as a trunk, and that's it, inter-vlan routing will be done. Now you just need to create an ACL to limit that traffic. Regards, Julio

The answer is explained  here .
To quote:
A class is free to implement
comparison any way it chooses, and it
can choose to make comparison against
None mean something (which actually
makes sense; if someone told you to
implement the None object from
scratch, how else would you get it to
compare True against itself?).
Practically-speaking, there is not much difference since custom comparison operators are rare.  But you should use  is None  as a general rule.

@myusuf3 You don't really need a proof for that.  is  is, basically, integer comparison while  ==  is not only resolving references but comparing values which may have mismatching types.

One on favour of ""is"". When a variable can be either None or something that has no meaningful comparison with None. For example, a variable can be a numpy.array or None (my particular case).

I would like to add to what @TimLudwinski is saying: first, if someone chose to override the equality operator to make None a special case, why would we want to tell them otherwise? Second, ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."" And the obvious way to check if something is equal to something is, well, the equality operator.

In this case, they are the same.  None  is a singleton object (there only ever exists one  None ).
is  checks to see if the object is the same object, while == just checks if they are equivalent.
For example:
p = [1]
q = [1]
p is q # False because they are not the same actual object
p == q # True because they are equivalent
But since there is only one  None , they will always be the same, and  is  will return True.
p = None
q = None
p is q # True because they are both pointing to the same ""None""

This answer is not correct, as explained in Ben Hoffstein's answer below  stackoverflow.com/questions/3257919/is-none-vs-none/… .  x == None  may evaluate to  True  even if  x  is not  None  but an instance of some class with its own custom equality operator.

From django doc:
SQLite is meant to be a lightweight
database, and thus can't support a
high level of concurrency.
OperationalError: database is locked
errors indicate that your application
is experiencing more concurrency than
sqlite can handle in default
configuration. This error means that
one thread or process has an exclusive
lock on the database connection and
another thread timed out waiting for
the lock the be released.
Python's SQLite wrapper has a default
timeout value that determines how long
the second thread is allowed to wait
on the lock before it times out and
raises the OperationalError: database
is locked error.
If you're getting this error, you can
solve it by:
Switching to another database backend.
At a certain point SQLite becomes too
""lite"" for real-world applications,
and these sorts of concurrency errors
indicate you've reached that point.
Rewriting your code to reduce
concurrency and ensure that database
transactions are short-lived.
Increase the default timeout value by
setting the timeout database option

Two concurrent transactions from different threads on the same process that both attempt to write to the database is more concurrency than sqlite can handle. My answer below has additional detail about this.

The practical reason for this is often that the python or django shells have opened a request to the DB and it wasn't closed properly; killing your terminal access often frees it up.  I had this error on running command line tests today.
Edit:  I get periodic upvotes on this.  If you'd like to kill access without rebooting the terminal, then from commandline you can do:
from django import db
db.connections.close_all()

+1 for the  db.connections.close_all()  tip. I was looking for something that would unlock the database before I shell out to a cleanup script in  tearDown() . This fixed it. Thanks.

In my case, It was because I open the database from SQLite Browser. When I close it from the browser, the problem is gone.

I disagree with @Patrick's answer which, by quoting this doc, implicitly links OP's problem ( Database is locked ) to this:
Switching to another database backend. At a certain point SQLite becomes too ""lite"" for real-world applications, and these sorts of concurrency errors indicate you've reached that point.
This is a bit ""too easy"" to incriminate SQlite for this problem (which is  very powerful  when correctly used; it's not only a toy for small databases, fun fact:  An SQLite database is limited in size to 140 terabytes ).
Unless you have a very busy server with thousands of connections at the same second,  the reason for this  Database is locked  error is probably more a bad use of the API, than a problem inherent to SQlite which would be ""too light"" . Here are more informations about  Implementation Limits for SQLite .
Now the solution:
I had the same problem when I was using two scripts using the same database at the same time:
one was accessing the DB with write operations
the other was accessing the DB in read-only
Solution:  always do  cursor.close()  as soon as possible after having done a (even read-only) query.
Here are more details .

A few hours ago, I agreed with you that it seems too easy to incriminate sqlite for this problem. But now I know that two simultaneous connections that start a transaction that includes a write operation is enough to get ""database is locked"". See my answer for more details.

@evan sqlite has a ""busy timeout"" .   If you set it to nonzero, you will never see this message even if many threads are accessing the db... unless those threads fail to close a transaction.   holding transactions and connections open kills sqlite ""concurrency""

As others have told, there is another process that is using the SQLite file and has not closed the connection. In case you are using Linux, you can see which processes are using the file (for example  db.sqlite3 ) using the  fuser  command as follows:
$ sudo fuser -v db.sqlite3
USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/path/to/db.sqlite3:
user    955 F.... apache2
If you want to stop the processes to release the lock, use  fuser -k  which sends the  KILL  signal to all processes accessing the file:
sudo fuser -k db.sqlite3
Note that this is dangerous as it might stop the web server process in a production server.
Thanks to @cz-game for pointing out  fuser !

I've got the same error! One of the reasons was the DB connection was not closed.
Therefore, check for  unclosed DB connections . Also, check if you have  committed  the DB before closing the connection.

I encountered this error message in a situation that is not (clearly) addressed by the help info linked in patrick's answer.
When I used  transaction.atomic()  to wrap a call to  FooModel.objects.get_or_create()  and called that code simultaneously from two different threads, only one thread would succeed, while the other would get the ""database is locked"" error. Changing the timeout database option had no effect on the behavior.
I think this is due to the fact that sqlite  cannot handle multiple simultaneous writers , so the application must serialize writes on their own.
I solved the problem by using a  threading.RLock  object instead of  transaction.atomic()  when my Django app is running with a sqlite backend. That's not entirely equivalent, so you may need to do something else in your application.
Here's my code that runs  FooModel.objects.get_or_create  simultaneously from two different threads, in case it is helpful:
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import configurations
configurations.setup()
from django.db import transaction
from submissions.models import ExerciseCollectionSubmission
def makeSubmission(user_id):
try:
with transaction.atomic():
e, _ = ExerciseCollectionSubmission.objects.get_or_create(
student_id=user_id, exercise_collection_id=172)
except Exception as e:
return f'failed: {e}'
e.delete()
return 'success'
futures = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
futures.append(executor.submit(makeSubmission, 296))
futures.append(executor.submit(makeSubmission, 297))
for future in futures:
print(future.result())

This also could happen if you are connected to your sqlite db via dbbrowser plugin through pycharm. Disconnection will solve the problem

In my case, I had not saved a database operation I performed within the SQLite Browser. Saving it solved the issue.

UPDATE  django version 2.1.7
I got this error  sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked  using  pytest  with  django .
Solution:
If we are using  @pytest.mark.django_db  decorator. What it does is create a  in-memory-db  for testing.
Named:  file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared  We can get this name with:
from django.db import connection
db_path = connection.settings_dict['NAME']
To access this database and also edit it, do:
Connect to the data base:
with sqlite3.connect(db_path, uri=True) as conn:
c = conn.cursor()
Use  uri=True  to specifies the disk file that is the SQLite database to be opened.
To avoid the error activate transactions in the decorator:
@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
Final function:
from django.db import connection
@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_mytest():
db_path = connection.settings_dict['NAME']
with sqlite3.connect(db_path, uri=True) as conn:
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('my amazing query')
conn.commit()
assert ... == ....

Are you saying that in-memory sqlite databases never raise the ""database is locked"" error? This answer is confusing because the original question doesn't involve  pytest  and I don't know what  pytest.mark.django_db  does. The  sqlite docs  don't say that in-memory databases have any different concurrency constraints.

Command Prompt: 11 basic commands you should know (cd, dir, mkdir, etc.)
Tutorial  by  Codrut Neagu
published on  10/18/2018
Geeks and experts love the  Command Prompt  because of the advanced commands it can run. Fortunately,  Command Prompt  is not built only on advanced commands, but also on simple ones, designed to perform basic operations. In this article, we show you how to execute commands such as changing the current directory, switching to another drive, viewing the contents of a directory, creating and renaming folders, copying, deleting files and folders, and launching applications from the  Command Prompt . We are also going to show you how to get help when using this app for Windows. Let's get started:
NOTE:  The information shared in this tutorial applies to Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7. Note that, for simplicity, we are using screenshots taken only in Windows 10.
1. How to change the directory (folder) in Command Prompt (CMD)
The first command from the list is  CD (Change Directory).  This command enables you to change the current directory or, in other words, to navigate to another folder from your PC. For instance, the command  CD\  takes you to the top of the directory tree. To see how it works, after you open the  Command Prompt , type  cd\  and press  Enter  on your keyboard. You should see how the  CD\  command takes you to the top of the directory tree. In this case, to the ""C:"" drive.
Running the CD\ command to change the directory to root Note that the  Command Prompt  is not case sensitive, meaning that you can type commands using capital letters, lowercase or any combination of them. The commands  CD, cd  or  Cd,  all work the same way.
Going back to the  ""CD\""  command, now you are working on the root of the ""C:"" drive. If you need to go to a specific folder from this drive run the command  ""CD Folder.""  The subfolders must be separated by a backslash character:  ""\.""  For instance, when you need to access the  System32  folder located in  ""C:\Windows,""  type  ""cd windows\system32\""  as shown below, and then press  Enter  on your keyboard.
Running the CD command to change the directory to a specific folder When you need to go one folder up, use the  ""cd..""  command. Let's assume that you want to go back to the  Windows  folder. Type  ""cd..""  and press  Enter  on your keyboard.
Running the CD.. command to go up one level in the directory tree The effect is that your current directory changes to  ""C:\Windows.""
2. How to change the drive in Command Prompt (CMD)
To access another drive, type the drive's letter, followed by  "":"" . For instance, if you wanted to change the drive from ""C:"" to ""D:"", you should type  ""d:""  and then press  Enter  on your keyboard.
Changing the drive in Command Prompt To change the drive and the directory at the same time, use the  cd  command, followed by the  ""/d""  switch. The  ""/d""  parameter is used to change the current drive to a specific folder from another disk volume.
For instance, if you are now on the ""D:"" drive and you want to go back to the  Windows  folder from the""C:"" drive, you should type  ""cd /d C:\Windows""  and press  Enter  on your keyboard, like in the following screenshot.
Changing the drive and directory in Command Prompt NOTE:  By typing only the drive letter you automatically move to your most recent location on that drive. For instance, if you are on ""D:"" drive and type  ""cd c:\windows""  nothing seems to happen. However, if you type  ""c:""  then the working folder changes to  ""c:\windows,""  assuming that it was the last folder you worked with on your ""C:"" drive.
3. How to view the contents of a directory in Command Prompt (CMD)
You can view the contents of a folder by using a command called  DIR . To test it, we have created a folder named  Digital_Citizen  on the D: drive, with several files and subfolders. You can see them in the screenshot below.
A folder found in the root of the D drive The last time, our working folder was  ""C:\Windows.""  To navigate to the folder mentioned above, we have to use the command  ""cd /d D:\Digital_Citizen.""  To view the contents of the folder, type  DIR , and press  Enter . The list of the files and folders contained by it is displayed, together with some details about each of them (the size and the date and time when they were last modified).
Using the DIR command to see the contents of a directory 4. How to create a new directory with Command Prompt (CMD)
You can make a new folder using the  MKDIR (Make Directory)  or the  MD  command. The syntax of these commands is  ""MKDIR Folder""  or  ""MD Folder.""
Let's say we need to create a new folder called  Digital_Citizen_Life  that is going to be placed in the  ""D:\Digital_Citizen""  folder. To do that, we need to type  ""mkdir Digital_Citizen_Life""  and then press  Enter , as shown below.
The MKDIR command, in Command Prompt To test if it worked, use the  DIR  command again. The newly created folder appears in the list.
Using DIR to see the contents of the directory, in Command Prompt NOTE:  Do not forget that all these commands depend on the current location in the  Command Prompt . For instance, if you are on the ""C:"" drive and type  ""MKDIR test,""  the new folder is created in the root of the ""C:"" drive.
Another way to create a folder that does not involve being in the desired folder is to type the complete path of the new folder. For example, if you are working on the ""D:"" drive and you want to create a new folder in ""C:,"" called  other_stuff , type  ""mkdir c:\other_stuff""  and then press  Enter .
Using MKDIR to create a new directory, with a full path When you need to create a folder with subfolders at the same time, you can use the  ""MKDIR Folder\Subfolder""  command. For instance, if we type  ""mkdir Digital_Citizen_Tests\Beta\Test1""  three folders are created:  Digital_Citizen_Tests, Beta  and  Test1 , in a tree-like structure.
Creating a folder with subfolders, using MKDIR in Command Prompt 5. How to rename files and folders with Command Prompt (CMD)
To rename files and folders, you need to use the  REN (Rename)  command. To rename folders, type  ""ren Folder NewFolderName.""  For example, if we wanted to rename the  Digital_Citizen_Tests  folder to  Digital_Citizen_Final_Tests,  we should run  ""ren Digital_Citizen_Tests Digital_Citizen_Final_Tests""  and press  Enter .
Renaming folders with the REN command, in Command Prompt To rename a file, use the same command, like this:  ""ren filename.extension newname.extension"" . For instance, to rename the  Digital_Citizen_Picture1.bmp  file to  Image0.bmp,  we have to run the command  ""ren Digital_Citizen_Image1.bmp Image0.bmp""  command.
Renaming files with the REN command, in Command Prompt Read the second page of this tutorial if you want to learn how to copy files and folders, delete files and folders, start an application and get help when using the Command Prompt.

The performance impact of Precision Boost for AMD Ryzen processors
Misc  by  Codrut Neagu
published on  10/25/2019
Modern processors come with two stock frequencies, or clocks if you prefer, which tell us their base speed and their boost speed. To be able to adjust their speed on-the-fly, processors need algorithms that tell them when to do that. For AMD's Ryzen processors, those algorithms are called  Precision Boost . It is a feature that's built into them and which, theoretically, has a significant effect on their performance.

tempfile  â Generate temporary files and directories Â¶
Source code:   Lib/tempfile.py
This module creates temporary files and directories.  It works on all
supported platforms.  TemporaryFile ,  NamedTemporaryFile ,
TemporaryDirectory , and  SpooledTemporaryFile  are high-level
interfaces which provide automatic cleanup and can be used as
context managers.  mkstemp()  and
mkdtemp()  are lower-level functions which require manual cleanup.
All the user-callable functions and constructors take additional arguments which
allow direct control over the location and name of temporary files and
directories. Files names used by this module include a string of
random characters which allows those files to be securely created in
shared temporary directories.
To maintain backward compatibility, the argument order is somewhat odd; it
is recommended to use keyword arguments for clarity.
The module defines the following user-callable items:
tempfile. TemporaryFile ( mode='w+b' ,  buffering=None ,  encoding=None ,  newline=None ,  suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ,  * ,  errors=None ) Â¶
Return a  file-like object  that can be used as a temporary storage area.
The file is created securely, using the same rules as  mkstemp() . It will be destroyed as soon
as it is closed (including an implicit close when the object is garbage
collected).  Under Unix, the directory entry for the file is either not created at all or is removed
immediately after the file is created.  Other platforms do not support
this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this
function having or not having a visible name in the file system.
The resulting object can be used as a context manager (see
Examples ).  On completion of the context or
destruction of the file object the temporary file will be removed
from the filesystem.
The  mode  parameter defaults to  'w+b'  so that the file created can
be read and written without being closed.  Binary mode is used so that it
behaves consistently on all platforms without regard for the data that is
stored.   buffering ,  encoding ,  errors  and  newline  are interpreted as for
open() .
The  dir ,  prefix  and  suffix  parameters have the same meaning and
defaults as with  mkstemp() .
The returned object is a true file object on POSIX platforms.  On other
platforms, it is a file-like object whose  file  attribute is the
underlying true file object.
The  os.O_TMPFILE  flag is used if it is available and works
(Linux-specific, requires Linux kernel 3.11 or later).
Raises an  auditing event   tempfile.mkstemp  with argument  fullpath .
Changed in version 3.5:  The  os.O_TMPFILE  flag is now used if available.
Changed in version 3.8:  Added  errors  parameter.
tempfile. NamedTemporaryFile ( mode='w+b' ,  buffering=None ,  encoding=None ,  newline=None ,  suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ,  delete=True ,  * ,  errors=None ) Â¶
This function operates exactly as  TemporaryFile()  does, except that
the file is guaranteed to have a visible name in the file system (on
Unix, the directory entry is not unlinked).  That name can be retrieved
from the  name  attribute of the returned
file-like object.  Whether the name can be
used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is
still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot
on Windows NT or later).  If  delete  is true (the default), the file is
deleted as soon as it is closed.
The returned object is always a file-like object whose  file
attribute is the underlying true file object. This file-like object can
be used in a  with  statement, just like a normal file.
Raises an  auditing event   tempfile.mkstemp  with argument  fullpath .
Changed in version 3.8:  Added  errors  parameter.
tempfile. SpooledTemporaryFile ( max_size=0 ,  mode='w+b' ,  buffering=None ,  encoding=None ,  newline=None ,  suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ,  * ,  errors=None ) Â¶
This function operates exactly as  TemporaryFile()  does, except that
data is spooled in memory until the file size exceeds  max_size , or
until the fileâs  fileno()  method is called, at which point the
contents are written to disk and operation proceeds as with
TemporaryFile() .
The resulting file has one additional method,  rollover() , which
causes the file to roll over to an on-disk file regardless of its size.
The returned object is a file-like object whose  _file  attribute
is either an  io.BytesIO  or  io.StringIO  object (depending on
whether binary or text  mode  was specified) or a true file
object, depending on whether  rollover()  has been called.  This
file-like object can be used in a  with  statement, just like
a normal file.
Changed in version 3.3:  the truncate method now accepts a  size  argument.
Changed in version 3.8:  Added  errors  parameter.
tempfile. TemporaryDirectory ( suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ) Â¶
This function securely creates a temporary directory using the same rules as  mkdtemp() .
The resulting object can be used as a context manager (see
Examples ).  On completion of the context or destruction
of the temporary directory object the newly created temporary directory
and all its contents are removed from the filesystem.
The directory name can be retrieved from the  name  attribute of the
returned object.  When the returned object is used as a context manager, the
name  will be assigned to the target of the  as  clause in
the  with  statement, if there is one.
The directory can be explicitly cleaned up by calling the
cleanup()  method.
Raises an  auditing event   tempfile.mkdtemp  with argument  fullpath .
New in version 3.2.
tempfile. mkstemp ( suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ,  text=False ) Â¶
Creates a temporary file in the most secure manner possible.  There are
no race conditions in the fileâs creation, assuming that the platform
properly implements the  os.O_EXCL  flag for  os.open() .  The
file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID.  If the
platform uses permission bits to indicate whether a file is executable,
the file is executable by no one.  The file descriptor is not inherited
by child processes.
Unlike  TemporaryFile() , the user of  mkstemp()  is responsible
for deleting the temporary file when done with it.
If  suffix  is not  None , the file name will end with that suffix,
otherwise there will be no suffix.   mkstemp()  does not put a dot
between the file name and the suffix; if you need one, put it at the
beginning of  suffix .
If  prefix  is not  None , the file name will begin with that prefix;
otherwise, a default prefix is used.  The default is the return value of
gettempprefix()  or  gettempprefixb() , as appropriate.
If  dir  is not  None , the file will be created in that directory;
otherwise, a default directory is used.  The default directory is chosen
from a platform-dependent list, but the user of the application can
control the directory location by setting the  TMPDIR ,  TEMP  or  TMP
environment variables.  There is thus no guarantee that the generated
filename will have any nice properties, such as not requiring quoting
when passed to external commands via  os.popen() .
If any of  suffix ,  prefix , and  dir  are not
None , they must be the same type.
If they are bytes, the returned name will be bytes instead of str.
If you want to force a bytes return value with otherwise default behavior,
pass  suffix=b'' .
If  text  is specified, it indicates whether to open the file in binary
mode (the default) or text mode.  On some platforms, this makes no
difference.
mkstemp()  returns a tuple containing an OS-level handle to an open
file (as would be returned by  os.open() ) and the absolute pathname
of that file, in that order.
Raises an  auditing event   tempfile.mkstemp  with argument  fullpath .
Changed in version 3.5:  suffix ,  prefix , and  dir  may now be supplied in bytes in order to
obtain a bytes return value.  Prior to this, only str was allowed.
suffix  and  prefix  now accept and default to  None  to cause
an appropriate default value to be used.
Changed in version 3.6:  The  dir  parameter now accepts a  path-like object .
tempfile. mkdtemp ( suffix=None ,  prefix=None ,  dir=None ) Â¶
Creates a temporary directory in the most secure manner possible. There
are no race conditions in the directoryâs creation.  The directory is
readable, writable, and searchable only by the creating user ID.
The user of  mkdtemp()  is responsible for deleting the temporary
directory and its contents when done with it.
The  prefix ,  suffix , and  dir  arguments are the same as for
mkstemp() .
mkdtemp()  returns the absolute pathname of the new directory.
Raises an  auditing event   tempfile.mkdtemp  with argument  fullpath .
Changed in version 3.5:  suffix ,  prefix , and  dir  may now be supplied in bytes in order to
obtain a bytes return value.  Prior to this, only str was allowed.
suffix  and  prefix  now accept and default to  None  to cause
an appropriate default value to be used.
Changed in version 3.6:  The  dir  parameter now accepts a  path-like object .
tempfile. gettempdir ( ) Â¶
Return the name of the directory used for temporary files. This
defines the default value for the  dir  argument to all functions
in this module.
Python searches a standard list of directories to find one which
the calling user can create files in.  The list is:
The directory named by the  TMPDIR  environment variable.
The directory named by the  TEMP  environment variable.
The directory named by the  TMP  environment variable.
A platform-specific location:
On Windows, the directories  C:\TEMP ,  C:\TMP ,
\TEMP , and  \TMP , in that order.
On all other platforms, the directories  /tmp ,  /var/tmp , and
/usr/tmp , in that order.
As a last resort, the current working directory.
The result of this search is cached, see the description of
tempdir  below.
tempfile. gettempdirb ( ) Â¶
Same as  gettempdir()  but the return value is in bytes.
New in version 3.5.
tempfile. gettempprefix ( ) Â¶
Return the filename prefix used to create temporary files.  This does not
contain the directory component.
tempfile. gettempprefixb ( ) Â¶
Same as  gettempprefix()  but the return value is in bytes.
New in version 3.5.
The module uses a global variable to store the name of the directory
used for temporary files returned by  gettempdir() .  It can be
set directly to override the selection process, but this is discouraged.
All functions in this module take a  dir  argument which can be used
to specify the directory and this is the recommended approach.
tempfile. tempdir Â¶
When set to a value other than  None , this variable defines the
default value for the  dir  argument to the functions defined in this
module.
If  tempdir  is  None  (the default) at any call to any of the above
functions except  gettempprefix()  it is initialized following the
algorithm described in  gettempdir() .
Examples Â¶
Here are some examples of typical usage of the  tempfile  module:
>>>  import   tempfile
# create a temporary file and write some data to it
>>>  fp   =   tempfile . TemporaryFile ()
>>>  fp . write ( b 'Hello world!' )
# read data from file
>>>  fp . seek ( 0 )
>>>  fp . read ()
b'Hello world!'
# close the file, it will be removed
>>>  fp . close ()
# create a temporary file using a context manager
>>>  with   tempfile . TemporaryFile ()   as   fp :
...       fp . write ( b 'Hello world!' )
...       fp . seek ( 0 )
...       fp . read ()
b'Hello world!'
>>>
# file is now closed and removed
# create a temporary directory using the context manager
>>>  with   tempfile . TemporaryDirectory ()   as   tmpdirname :
...       print ( 'created temporary directory' ,   tmpdirname )
>>>
# directory and contents have been removed
Deprecated functions and variables Â¶
A historical way to create temporary files was to first generate a
file name with the  mktemp()  function and then create a file
using this name. Unfortunately this is not secure, because a different
process may create a file with this name in the time between the call
to  mktemp()  and the subsequent attempt to create the file by the
first process. The solution is to combine the two steps and create the
file immediately. This approach is used by  mkstemp()  and the
other functions described above.
tempfile. mktemp ( suffix='' ,  prefix='tmp' ,  dir=None ) Â¶
Deprecated since version 2.3:  Use  mkstemp()  instead.
Return an absolute pathname of a file that did not exist at the time the
call is made.  The  prefix ,  suffix , and  dir  arguments are similar
to those of  mkstemp() , except that bytes file names,  suffix=None
and  prefix=None  are not supported.
Warning
Use of this function may introduce a security hole in your program.  By
the time you get around to doing anything with the file name it returns,
someone else may have beaten you to the punch.   mktemp()  usage can
be replaced easily with  NamedTemporaryFile() , passing it the
delete=False  parameter:
>>>  f   =   NamedTemporaryFile ( delete = False )
>>>  f . name
'/tmp/tmptjujjt'
>>>  f . write ( b ""Hello World! \n "" )
13
>>>  f . close ()
>>>  os . unlink ( f . name )
>>>  os . path . exists ( f . name )
False

Sooner or later you will get links to interesting material and interesting open or members only forums / websites.  Similar things are attracted to similar things.  On open forums (the kind you can find in various online lists named something like ""Best forums to learn information security"") do your best to appear knowledgeable and interesting yourself, and interesting people will come by themselves, engage them and see where that leads you.  Some people like to list their forum accounts in their signatures; you can google people's handles and see which forums they think are worthy of their time (on IRC you can do something similar, /whois people you like and see where they hang out at), you could do the same with nicks you see mentioned in various leaks/exploits/research; find material you like, Google the URI and see which other places link to it, chances are it is what you want. But I can't stress enough that you should be  talking to people. I used to be interested in similar topics a couple of years ago, and was pretty active in various places; absolutely all of them were made known to me by people I met elsewhere. 2.4k views  ·  View 2 Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below What are the good forums for computer networking topics and discussions?

The DNS protocol is used to resolve FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names) to IP addresses around the world. This allows us to successfully find and connect to Internet websites and services no matter where they are. Its usefulness, however, doesn't stop there: local company and private networks also rely on DNS to operate efficiently and correctly.
In many cases, where a local DNS server is not available, we are forced to either use our ISP's DNS servers or some public DNS server, however, this can sometimes prove troublesome. Today, small low-end routers have the ability to integrate DNS functionality, making life easier, but so do Cisco routers - they simply have to be setup and you're done.
This article will show you how to configure your Cisco router to provide DNS services to your network, and make all clients use it as a DNS server. Our easy to follow step-by-step process ensures you'll understand the process and have it running within minutes.
Example Scenario
Consider the following network diagram. This is our example network, we'd like to enable the DNS Service so our workstations can properly resolve Internet domains but also local network names.
First step is to enable the DNS service and domain lookup on the router:
R1#  configure terminal  R1(config)#  ip dns server   R1(config)#   ip domain-lookup
Next, we need to configure the router with a public name-server, this will force the router to perform recursive DNS lookups, in other words, for every request it receives from our workstations the router will try to find the answer by asking as many DNS servers it needs, and finally return with an answer:
R1(config)#  ip name-server 4.2.2.5  R1(config)#  ip name-server 4.2.2.6
The Cisco IOS will allow you to enter up to 6 different name servers (essentially DNS servers). Usually you would use your ISP's DNS server to ensure you have quick responses, then place a few free public DNS servers such as the ones above. This will ensure that you'll get a DNS response from either your ISP or public DNS servers.
Next step is to configure your DNS server with the host names of your local network, this way when Alan's PC trys to ping or connect to Wayne, the router will successfully resolve its netbios name to the appropriate IP address:
R1(config)#  ip host alan 192.168.1.10  R1(config)#  ip host john 192.168.1.11  R1(config)#  ip host wayne 192.168.1.12
If you now try to ping 'wayne' directly from your router's CLI prompt, you should receive an answer:
R1#  ping wayne Type escape sequence to abort.  Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.168.1.12, timeout is 2 seconds:  !!!!!  Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms
At this point, you can configure your workstations to use your router's IP address as the primary DNS server:
Article Summary
We've covered how a Cisco router can be used as a basic DNS server to enable network clients to perform DNS queries for the local network and Internet.
Future articles in DNS will cover more advanced configurations, including full domain resource records, DNS load balancing and more.

How do I make a:
if str(variable) == [contains text]:
condition?
(or something, because I am pretty sure that what I just wrote is completely wrong)
I am sort of trying to check if a  random.choice  from my list is  ["""",]  (blank) or contains  [""text"",] .

You could just compare your string to the empty string:
if variable != """":
etc.
But you can abbreviate that as follows:
if variable:
etc.
Explanation: An  if  actually works by computing a value for the logical expression you give it:  True  or  False . If you simply use a variable name (or a literal string like ""hello"") instead of a logical test, the rule is: An empty string counts as False, all other strings count as True. Empty lists and the number zero also count as false, and most other things count as true.

This is not the SAME. Do not do this. In [14]: a = """"  In [15]: if a.replace(' ', ''):     ...:     print 1     ...:  In [16]: if a.replace(' ', '') == """":     ...:     print 1     ...: 1

Oh right, what @AndreaBergonzo said: When you compare a string to """", you're checking if it's empty-- which counts as False.

The ""Pythonic"" way to check if a string is empty is:
import random
variable = random.choice(l)
if variable:
# got a non-empty string
else:
# got an empty string

Just say  if s  or  if not s . As in
s = ''
if not s:
print 'not', s
So in your specific example, if I understand it correctly...
>>> import random
>>> l = ['', 'foo', '', 'bar']
>>> def default_str(l):
...     s = random.choice(l)
...     if not s:
...         print 'default'
...     else:
...         print s
...
>>> default_str(l)
default
>>> default_str(l)
default
>>> default_str(l)
bar
>>> default_str(l)
default

I dont get it. so, if i do ""variable = random.choice(list)"" and the variable is a blank """", then i can just do the condition ""if variable:"" and... yeah, i dont really get anything else of what you wrote...

@user1275670, it sounds like you do understand. But I added another example just in case. In short  ''  evaluates to  False , so if you want to get  True  when  s  is an empty string, you say  if not s .

For python 3, you can use  bool()
>>> bool(None)
False
>>> bool("""")
False
>>> bool(""a"")
True
>>> bool(""ab"")
True

True

Some time we have more spaces in between quotes, then use this approach
a = ""   ""
>>> bool(a)
True
>>> bool(a.strip())
False
if not a.strip():
print(""String is empty"")
else:

While this answer is probably correct and useful, it is preferred if you include some explanation along with it to explain how it helps to solve the problem. This becomes especially useful in the future, if there is a change (possibly unrelated) that causes it to stop working and users need to understand how it once worked.

Does Python have something like an empty string variable where you can do:
if myString == string.empty:
Regardless, what's the most elegant way to check for empty string values? I find hard coding  """"  every time for checking an empty string not as good.

Empty strings are  ""falsy""  which means they are considered false in a Boolean context, so you can just do this:
if not myString:
This is the preferred way if you know that your variable is a string.  If your variable could also be some other type then you should use  myString == """" .  See the documentation on  Truth Value Testing  for other values that are false in Boolean contexts.

OP wants to know if the variable is an empty string, but you would also enter the  if not myString:  block if  myString  were  None ,  0 ,  False  etc.  So if you aren't sure what type  myString  is, you should use  if myString == """":  to determine if it is an empty string as opposed to some other falsy value.
–  Andrew Clark

@AndrewClark, for such a case, instead of a chain of  if myString == ...  expressions, we could use  if myString in (None, '')  or per @Bartek,  if myString in (None, '') or not myString.strip()

From  PEP 8 , in the  “Programming Recommendations” section :
For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.
So you should use:
if not some_string:
or:
if some_string:
Just to clarify, sequences are  evaluated  to  False  or  True  in a Boolean context if they are empty or not. They are  not equal  to  False  or  True .

PS: In the PEP's defense, one could argue that saying "" x is false "" (lowercase  false ) already means that, rather than meaning  x == False . But IMHO the clarification is still welcome given the target audience.

The most elegant way would probably be to simply check if its true or falsy, e.g.:
if not my_string:
However, you may want to strip white space because:
>>> bool("""")
False
>>> bool(""   "")
True
>>> bool(""   "".strip())
False
You should probably be a bit more explicit in this however, unless you know for sure that this string has passed some kind of validation and is a string that can be tested this way.

I would test noneness before stripping. Also, I would use the fact that empty strings are False (or Falsy). This approach is similar to  Apache's StringUtils.isBlank  or  Guava's Strings.isNullOrEmpty
This is what I would use to test if a string is either None OR Empty OR Blank:
def isBlank (myString):
if myString and myString.strip():
#myString is not None AND myString is not empty or blank
return False
#myString is None OR myString is empty or blank
return True
And, the exact opposite to test if a string is not None NOR Empty NOR Blank:
def isNotBlank (myString):
if myString and myString.strip():
#myString is not None AND myString is not empty or blank
return True
#myString is None OR myString is empty or blank
return False
More concise forms of the above code:
def isBlank (myString):
return not (myString and myString.strip())
def isNotBlank (myString):
return bool(myString and myString.strip())

How is it different from  string and not string.isspace() ?

More concise for those who care about such things:  def isBlank(s): return not (s and s.strip())  and  def isNotBlank(s): return s and s.strip() .

I once wrote something similar to Bartek's answer and javascript inspired:
def is_not_blank(s):
return bool(s and s.strip())
Test:
print is_not_blank("""")    # False
print is_not_blank(""   "") # False
print is_not_blank(""ok"")  # True
print is_not_blank(None)  # False

The only really solid way of doing this is the following:
if """".__eq__(myString):
All other solutions have possible problems and edge cases where the check can fail.
len(myString)==0  can fail if  myString  is an object of a class that inherits from  str  and overrides the  __len__()  method.
Similarly  myString == """"  and  myString.__eq__("""")  can fail if  myString  overrides  __eq__()  and  __ne__() .
For some reason  """" == myString  also gets fooled if  myString  overrides  __eq__() .
myString is """"  and  """" is myString  are equivalent. They will both fail if  myString  is not actually a string but a subclass of string (both will return  False ). Also, since they are identity checks, the only reason why they work is because Python uses String Pooling (also called String Internment) which uses the same instance of a string if it is interned (see here:  Why does comparing strings using either '==' or 'is' sometimes produce a different result? ). And  """"  is interned from the start in CPython
The big problem with the identity check is that String Internment is (as far as I could find) that it is not standardised which strings are interned. That means, theoretically  """"  is not necessary interned and that is implementation dependant.
The only way of doing this that really cannot be fooled is the one mentioned in the beginning:  """".__eq__(myString) . Since this explicitly calls the  __eq__()  method of the empty string it cannot be fooled by overriding any methods in myString and solidly works with subclasses of  str .
Also relying on the falsyness of a string might not work if the object overrides it's  __bool__()  method.
This is not only theoretical work but might actually be relevant in real usage since I have seen frameworks and libraries subclassing  str  before and using  myString is """"  might return a wrong output there.
Also, comparing strings using  is  in general is a pretty evil trap since it will work correctly sometimes, but not at other times, since string pooling follows pretty strange rules.
That said, in most cases all of the mentioned solutions will work correctly. This is post is mostly academic work.

But if someone overrode  eq  or  ne  then there is presumably a reason...

@simpleuser you are of course right. In the real world it is completely ok to use the falsiness of the string or compare it to an empty string. This here answer is overkill on purpose.

Test empty or blank string (shorter way):
if myString.strip():
print(""it's not an empty or blank string"")
else:
print(""it's an empty or blank string"")

If you want to differentiate between empty and null strings, I would suggest using  if len(string) , otherwise, I'd suggest using simply  if string  as others have said.  The caveat about strings full of whitespace still applies though, so don't forget to  strip .

I don't know why you'd want to avoid using """", unless it impacts performance somehow, but I prefer your answer to the one with zillions of upvotes, as it's less confusing. However, I wanted to point out that an empty list is also False, apparently.

I find hardcoding(sic) """" every time for checking an empty string not as good.
Clean code approach
Doing this:  foo == """"  is very bad practice.  """"  is a magical value. You should never check against magical values (more commonly known as  magical numbers )
What you should do is compare to a descriptive variable name.
Descriptive variable names
One may think that ""empty_string"" is a descriptive variable name.  It isn't .
Before you go and do  empty_string = """"  and think you have a great variable name to compare to. This is not what ""descriptive variable name"" means.
A good descriptive variable name is based on its context.
You have to think about what the empty string  is .
Where does it come from.
Why is it there.
Why do you need to check for it.
Simple form field example
You are building a form where a user can enter values. You want to check if the user wrote something or not.
A good variable name may be  not_filled_in
This makes the code very readable
if formfields.name == not_filled_in:
raise ValueError(""We need your name"")
Thorough CSV parsing example
You are parsing CSV files and want the empty string to be parsed as  None
(Since CSV is entirely text based, it cannot represent  None  without using predefined keywords)
A good variable name may be  CSV_NONE
This makes the code easy to change and adapt if you have a new CSV file that represents  None  with another string than  """"
if csvfield == CSV_NONE:
csvfield = None
There are no questions about if this piece of code is correct. It is pretty clear that it does what it should do.
Compare this to
if csvfield == EMPTY_STRING:
csvfield = None
The first question here is, Why does the empty string deserve special treatment?
This would tell future coders that an empty string should always be considered as  None .
This is because it mixes business logic (What CSV value should be  None ) with code implementation (What are we actually comparing to)
There needs to be a  separation of concern  between the two.

Does one really need to go to that much trouble to avoid a """"? In the context of comparison what else could a blank string mean?
–  user5451396
Aug 23 '18 at 17:57
As I write in my answer, CSV cannot represent null without using a string. If you are context free then congratulations! Most code isn't.

I would disagree with that answer. Magic numbers are bad, that makes sense. Magic values in general as well. But  """"  is not a magic value, same as  True ,  False  or  None  aren't magic values.

How about this?  Perhaps it's not ""the most elegant"", but it seems pretty complete and clear:
if (s is None) or (str(s).strip()==""""): // STRING s IS ""EMPTY""...

I assume you mean nothing but white space? You are referring to my use of strip()?  For most purposes that IS empty!  It is ridiculously common to compound something like s.trim().isEmpty()

Responding to @1290. Sorry, no way to format blocks in comments. The  None  value is not an empty string in Python, and neither is (spaces). The answer from Andrew Clark is the correct one:  if not myString . The answer from @rouble is application-specific and does not answer the OP's question. You will get in trouble if you adopt a peculiar definition of what is a ""blank"" string. In particular, the standard behavior is that  str(None)  produces  'None' , a non-blank string.
However if you must treat  None  and (spaces) as ""blank"" strings, here is a better way:
class weirdstr(str):
def __new__(cls, content):
return str.__new__(cls, content if content is not None else '')
def __nonzero__(self):
return bool(self.strip())
Examples:
>>> normal = weirdstr('word')
>>> print normal, bool(normal)
word True
>>> spaces = weirdstr('   ')
>>> print spaces, bool(spaces)
False
>>> blank = weirdstr('')
>>> print blank, bool(blank)
False
>>> none = weirdstr(None)
>>> print none, bool(none)
False
>>> if not spaces:
...     print 'This is a so-called blank string'
...
This is a so-called blank string
Meets the @rouble requirements while not breaking the expected  bool  behavior of strings.

I find this elegant as it makes sure it is a string and checks its length:
def empty(mystring):
assert isinstance(mystring, str)
if len(mystring) == 0:
return True
else:
return False

You may have a look at this  Assigning empty value or string in Python
This is about comparing strings that are empty. So instead of testing for emptiness with  not , you may test is your string is equal to empty string with  """"  the empty string...

When you are reading file by lines and want to determine, which line is empty, make sure you will use  .strip() , because there is new line character in ""empty"" line:
lines = open(""my_file.log"", ""r"").readlines()
for line in lines:
if not line.strip():
continue
# your code for non-empty lines

not str(myString)
This expression is True for strings that are empty. Non-empty strings, None and non-string objects will all produce False, with the caveat that objects may override __str__ to thwart this logic by returning a falsy value.

If you just use
not var1
it is not possible to difference a variable which is boolean  False  from an empty string  '' :
var1 = ''
not var1
> True
var1 = False
not var1
> True
However, if you add a simple condition to your script, the difference is made:
var1  = False
not var1 and var1 != ''
> True
var1 = ''
not var1 and var1 != ''
> False

In case this is useful to someone, here is a quick function i built out to replace blank strings with N/A's in lists of lists (python 2).
y = [[""1"",""2"",""""],[""1"",""4"",""""]]
def replace_blank_strings_in_lists_of_lists(list_of_lists):
new_list = []
for one_list in list_of_lists:
new_one_list = []
for element in one_list:
if element:
new_one_list.append(element)
else:
new_one_list.append(""N/A"")
new_list.append(new_one_list)
return new_list
x= replace_blank_strings_in_lists_of_lists(y)
print x
This is useful for posting lists of lists to a mysql database that does not accept blanks for certain fields (fields marked as NN in schema.  in my case, this was due to a composite primary key).

Support has been slow and unknowledgeable. Product works decent enough, hopefully you don't need support to troubleshoot if there's issues.

type and isinstance in Python
type in Python
Python have a built-in method called as type which generally come in handy while figuring out the type of variable used in the program in the runtime.
If a single argument (object) is passed to type() built-in, it returns type of the given object. If three arguments (name, bases and dict) are passed, it returns a new type object.
Syntax:
type(object)
type(name, bases, dict)
type() With a Single Object Parameter

code
# Python code type() with a single object parameter
x  =   5
s  =   ""geeksforgeeks""
y  =   [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
print ( type (x))
print ( type (s))
print ( type (y))

Output:
class 'int'
class 'str'

class   test:
a  =   'Foo'
b  =   12
o2  =   type ( 'Y' , (test,),  dict (a = 'Foo' , b = 12 ))
print ( type (o2))
print ( vars (o2))

If you need to check type of an object, it is recommended to use Python isinstance() function instead. It’s because isinstance() function also checks if the given object is an instance of the subclass.
isinstance()
The isinstance() function checks if the object (first argument) is an instance or subclass of classinfo class (second argument).
Syntax:
isinstance(object, classinfo)
The isinstance() takes two parameters:
object :  object to be checked
classinfo  : class, type, or tuple of classes and types
Return Value :
true  if the object is an instance or subclass of a class, or any element of the tuple  false  otherwise. If class info is not a type or tuple of types, a TypeError exception is raised.

type() vs. isinstance()
One elementary error people make is using the type() function where isinstance() would be more appropriate.
If you’re checking to see if an object has a certain type, you want isinstance() as it checks to see if the object passed in the first argument is of the type of any of the type objects passed in the second argument. Thus, it works as expected with subclassing and old-style classes, all of which have the legacy type object instance.
type(), on the other hand, simply returns the type object of an object and comparing what it returns to another type object will only yield True when you use the exact same type object on both sides.
In Python, it’s preferable to use Duck Typing( type checking be deferred to run-time, and is implemented by means of dynamic typing or reflection) rather than inspecting the type of an object.

pass
class   Fox(Animal):
name  =   ""Fox""
class   Bear(Animal):
name  =   ""Bear""
# Use the .name attribute (or property) regardless of the type
for   a  in   [User( ""Geeksforgeeks"" ), Fox(), Bear()]:
print (a.name)

The next reason not to use type() is the lack of support for inheritance.

The MyDict class has all the properties of a dict, without any new methods. It will behave exactly like a dictionary. But type() will not return the expected result.
Using isinstance() is preferable in this case because it will give the expected result:

Presenting CentOS Stream
Today, CentOS Stream is available based on CentOS Linux 8 software packages the project has been building over the summer combined with the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 development kernel. You can read the  release announcement here .  CentOS Stream will be a rolling-release Linux distro that exists as a midstream between the upstream development in Fedora Linux and the downstream development for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is a cleared-path to contributing into future minor releases of RHEL while interacting with Red Hat and other open source developers. This pairs nicely with the existing contribution path in Fedora for future major releases of RHEL.`  Over the coming months, the CentOS Project and Red Hat Engineering plan to begin updating the packages in CentOS Stream to reflect the in-progress development toward the next minor release of RHEL. This, for the first time, makes the CentOS Project a part of the RHEL platform development cycle.  During this period, and with community support, Red Hat and the CentOS Project will develop the processes necessary to help CentOS Stream evolve rapidly to serve the needs of current and future CentOS distro users and to enable developers in new and interesting ways, all while helping to contribute to the broader platform.  In the past there was no way to contribute to the upstream via the CentOS Project. That changes with CentOS Stream -- you can make stronger, more direct connections to the operating system developers of the Fedora Project, reducing the feedback loop into the distro creation itself. Bringing the diversity of all developer voices to the room when RHEL is being planned and created.  During the introduction and build-out of CentOS Stream, we want to make sure we’re helping CentOS distro users however you need it. Come  join the conversation  and help us create the future.
Why create CentOS Stream?
With Red Hat’s help, the CentOS Project created a framework for  Special Interest Groups (SIGs)  to develop and expand in each of their respective technical areas. This approach works well enough, but causes a fairly substantial package churn for everyone around the time a new minor version is released. With CentOS Linux as a strict downstream from RHEL, each minor point release brings large upgrades to multiple areas of the distribution, often resulting in weeks of delays and compatibility problems for the SIGs as they rebuild against the updated packages, having had little-to-no visibility of the change delta. CentOS Stream will help address these issues.  First, it eliminates the need for mass rebuilds of the distribution and SIG contents. Because the updates change from a mass batch-style to a stream of developmental packages as they happen, the updates are more frequent, but less world-altering in that packages will change a few at a time, rather than the 600-700 packages that update all at once.   Second, because this is a path to deliver patches and changes to the RHEL development packages, the community will have a chance to weigh in on features and fixes by submitting pull requests, adding comments, and participating in discussions about use cases before the features land in RHEL. This change will give the community a way to test and contribute to the RHEL process in a way that wasn’t previously available.  Last, and especially useful across the open source development ecosystem, this new method will provide layered projects built atop CentOS Stream, such as Ansible, oVirt, and RDO, and the SIGs that shepherd that work, a way to publicly develop against what’s coming in RHEL, rather than scrambling to catch up, or waiting months for a platform they can use in various public CI infrastructures.
Install Media
For initial release a  DVD ISO  is available.  Various installation images will eventually be available for installing CentOS Stream. Which image you need to download depends on your installation environment. All of these images can either be burned on a DVD or dd’ed to an USB memory stick.  If you are unsure which image to use, pick the DVD image.  It allows selecting which components you want to install and contains all packages that can be selected from the GUI installer.
Verifying Downloaded Installation Images
Before copying the image to your preferred installation media you should  check the sha256sum  of the downloaded installation images.  # CentOS-Stream-x86_64-boot.iso: 558891008 bytes

Differences in CentOS Stream from CentOS Linux 8.0.1905
This section of the release notes will soon detail where to see the packages as they are being moved forward to be based on the RHEL minor development tree.  Until then, this section will document key changes between the two distros to begin marking how CentOS Stream is pulling forward of CentOS Linux.
Kernel -- kernel-4.18.0-144.el8
The Linux kernel is the first part of CentOS Stream to move ahead of the upcoming RHEL point release.  Check back here for updates about that kernel as people beginning using it.
All other release notes
For any packages or systems not discussed in these release notes, refer to the  CentOS Linux 8 release notes  as primary.
How to help and get help
As a CentOS user there are various ways you can help out with the CentOS community. Take a look at our  Contribute  page for further information on how to get involved.
Participate in CentOS Stream
Interested in participating in the development of RHEL through CentOS Stream?  Join open source developers in discussing CentOS Stream on the  centos-devel  mailing list.
Special Interest Groups
CentOS consists of different  Special Interest Groups  (SIGs) that bring together people with similar interests. The following SIGs already exist (among others):  Artwork  - create and improve artwork for CentOS releases and promotion  Promotion  - help promoting CentOS online or at events  Cloud  - work on the leading-edge of open source cloud technologies  Virtualization  - unite people around virtualization in CentOS  And we encourage people to join any of these SIGs or start up a new SIG, e.g.  ARM, PPC and i386 port - help with porting CentOS to other architectures  Hardware compatibility - provide feedback about specific hardware  RPM Packaging - contribute new useful RPM packages  Translation - help translating the documentation, website and Wiki content
Mailing Lists and Forums
Another way you can help others in the community is by actively helping and resolving problems that users come up against in  the mailing lists  and  the forums .
Wiki and Website
Even as an inexperienced CentOS user we can use your help. Because we like to know what problems you encountered, if you had problems finding specific information, how you would improve documentation so it becomes more accessible. This kind of feedback is as valuable to others as it would have been to you so your involvement is required to make CentOS better.  So if you want to help out and improve our documentation and Wiki,  register on the Wiki  or subscribe to the  centos-docs  mailing list.
IRC Presence
The CentOS Project maintains a presence on the freenode IRC network as an additional venue for community support and interaction.  Please see our  IRC wiki article  for more information.
Thanks
We thank everyone involved for helping us produce this product and would like to specifically acknowledge the extra effort made by the QA Team. Without them working lots and lots of hours in evenings, nights, weekends and holidays, we couldn't have released this Release in the time we did. A special thanks also goes to the CentOS-community. A more complete list of the contributors to this release can be found at /usr/share/doc/centos-release/Contributors of your new installation.

I've downloaded the  LiveGNOME  iso for  CentOS 7  and use  rufus  to make CentOS 7 Live-USB that I can boot a Centos 7 with it.
But after I boot it I've set up some settings, then I shut down it, later I boot it again, and I found out **all the settings and data are reset ** I can't believe it, so I redo the settings and chose restart option, but surprisingly, it resets again.
I've tried to found document with the keyword  centos 7 live-usb save settings  but I can found nothing, only thing I found is with the same case but on Ubuntu you can use  persistence mode (even I don't know what is it)  but can't figure or found documents that tells you how to do it on CentOS 7.
So how can I let the CentOS 7 on my USB (it's installed on USB, not iso on USB to install centos on PC) save settings and documents I saved on it, and does not reset when it's reboot?

The ""live"" media is designed to not have persistent changes across boots. If you want changes to be persistent, you will need to install the ""full"" version on the USB stick.

@RamanSailopal then if I install  full  version should I just drop the iso on USB or still use  Rufus  and will it has to option to boot on it instead of installing to PC?

If you run off a live CD for example and then plug in the USB, you should be able to install to the USB.

How? I've tried to put the everything iso into USB with Rufus but after booting on it it shows installing CentOS which I think it'll install to PC instead of the start CentOS view which I've seen on LiveGNOME iso

I could suggest you making a bootable usb with persistent storage as compared to what you trying to achieve here.
This of course allow to start a PC with Centos and even you can save whatever your doing there. Once it reboots, yes you will have that worked files after all.
first login to a Centos install pc.
Lets install required packages;
# yum install -y epel-release
# yum install livecd-tools syslinux
Insert the USB thumb & mark its partition as bootable(replace the X with your usb);
# parted /dev/sdX
[parted] toggle 1 boot
[parted] quit
Now you can create your Centos bootable usb with persistent storage
# livecd-iso-to-disk --home-size-mb 500 CentOS-7.0-x64_84-LiveCD.iso /dev/sdX1
Thats it.. Now you can use the usb and run it with installed Centos version with persistant storage.

Can the following process works?  Boot with live-USB (which will reset) -> run the commands -> install centos 7 (which won't reset) to another USB ?
–  Andrew.Wolphoe
Dec 22 '17 at 14:16
No, it won't work. If you boot Live-usb, yet it is a non-persistent storage, so you can install permanent Centos there.  Above, what my solution is create the same Live-USB with ""persistent storage""
–  krs4keshara

so I must either use VM or a CentOS installed on PC in order to use above step to create a live-USB that won't reset right?

But it seems the centos can't found the USB, I'm running centos on VM, while my USB has 128GB storage and was formatted in exFAT, I don't know why everytime I plug it in  While in the VM tab , the windows get to read it first, and centos can't read it? How can this be solved?

How can I find the number of arguments of a Python function? I need to know how many normal arguments it has and how many named arguments.
Example:
def someMethod(self, arg1, kwarg1=None):
pass
This method has 2 arguments and 1 named argument.
python   function

the question is fully warranted; if it wasn't (since you can always read the source), there wouldn't be any justification for the  inspect  standard library module.
–  flow
May 26 '11 at 12:31
Plenty of languages implement at least one unjustified feature. The  inspect  module has a lot of other features, so it is unfair to say that the whole module would be unjustified if one particular function in it was. Moreover, it's easy to see how this feature could be used poorly. (See  stackoverflow.com/questions/741950 ). That said, it is a useful feature, especially for writing decorators and other functions that operate on function.

The previously accepted answer has been  deprecated  as of  Python 3.0 . Instead of using  inspect.getargspec  you should now opt for the  Signature  class which superseded it.
Creating a Signature for the function is easy via the  signature  function :
from inspect import signature
def someMethod(self, arg1, kwarg1=None):
pass
sig = signature(someMethod)
Now, you can either view its parameters quickly by  str ing it:
str(sig)  # returns: '(self, arg1, kwarg1=None)'
or you can also get a mapping of attribute names to parameter objects via  sig.parameters .
params = sig.parameters
print(params['kwarg1']) # prints: kwarg1=20
Additionally, you can call  len  on  sig.parameters  to also see the number of arguments this function requires:
print(len(params))  # 3
Each entry in the  params  mapping is actually a  Parameter  object  that has further attributes making your life easier. For example, grabbing a parameter and viewing its default value is now easily performed with:
kwarg1 = params['kwarg1']
kwarg1.default # returns: None
similarly for the rest of the objects contained in  parameters .
As for Python  2.x  users, while  inspect.getargspec   isn't  deprecated, the language will soon be :-). The  Signature  class isn't available in the  2.x  series and won't be. So you still need to work with  inspect.getargspec .
As for transitioning between Python 2 and 3, if you have code that relies on the interface of  getargspec  in Python 2 and switching to  signature  in  3  is too difficult,  you do have the valuable option  of using  inspect.getfullargspec . It offers a similar interface to  getargspec  (a single callable argument) in order to grab the arguments of a function while also handling some additional cases that  getargspec  doesn't:
from inspect import getfullargspec
def someMethod(self, arg1, kwarg1=None):
pass
args = getfullargspec(someMethod)
As with  getargspec ,  getfullargspec  returns a  NamedTuple  which contains the arguments.
print(args)
FullArgSpec(args=['self', 'arg1', 'kwarg1'], varargs=None, varkw=None, defaults=(None,), kwonlyargs=[], kwonlydefaults=None, annotations={})

Generally what you want, but this doesn't work for built-in functions. The only way to know to get this info for builtins is to parse their  doc  string, which is fugly but doable.

@elyase, just do:  dir(someMethod)  ->  'func_code' ; Go further:  dir(someMethod.func_code)  ->  'co_argcount' ; You can use the built-in  dir()  to determine available methods of an object.

In general, you  shouldn't  be peeking inside the function object to look at these things.  co_argcount  is used internally during evaluation of the code object. What I'm trying to say is, there's really no guarantees that these attributes won't change from one release to the other.

inspect.getargspec()
Get the names and default values of a function’s arguments. A tuple of four things is returned: (args, varargs, varkw, defaults). args is a list of the argument names (it may contain nested lists). varargs and varkw are the names of the * and ** arguments or None. defaults is a tuple of default argument values or None if there are no default arguments; if this tuple has n elements, they correspond to the last n elements listed in args.
Changed in version 2.6: Returns a named tuple ArgSpec(args, varargs, keywords, defaults).

Adding to the above, I've also seen that the most of the times help() function really helps
For eg, it gives all the details about the arguments it takes.
help(<method>)
gives the below

Retrieves a report which is a collection of properties / statistics for a specific customer.
Args:
date: string, Represents the date in yyyy-mm-dd format for which the data is to be fetched. (required)

parameters: string, Represents the application name, parameter name pairs to fetch in csv as app_name1:param_name1, app_name2:param_name2.
Returns:

help  function only shows what the docstring says. Have you even tested if it works with the function definition in the question?
–  0xc0de
Nov 2 '14 at 17:35
@0xc0de - Have you tested it? Because it actually does work.  help()  spits out more than just the docstring - even on undocumented code it still prints out the argspec and tells you where the code was defined. The person who posted the original question wasn't clear whether they needed an answer that was machine or human friendly. If it only needs to be human friendly,  help()  is perfectly adequate.
–  ArtOfWarfare
Jan 17 '16 at 23:09
@ArtOfWarfare not at all, as now you would have to parse whatever  help()  returns, and try and find the  args  and  kwargs .

Good news for folks who want to do this in a portable way between Python 2 and Python 3.6+: use  inspect.getfullargspec()  method. It works in both Python 2.x and 3.6+
As Jim Fasarakis Hilliard and others have pointed out, it used to be like this:
1. In Python 2.x: use  inspect.getargspec()
2. In Python 3.x: use signature, as  getargspec()  and  getfullargspec()  were deprecated.
However, starting Python 3.6 (by popular demand?), things have changed towards better:
From the Python 3  documentation page :
inspect.getfullargspec(func)
Changed in version 3.6 : This method was previously documented as deprecated in favour of  signature()  in Python 3.5, but that decision has been reversed in order to restore a clearly supported standard interface for single-source Python 2/3 code migrating away from the legacy  getargspec()  API.

As other answers suggest,  getargspec  works well as long as the thing being queried is actually a function. It does not work for  built-in  functions such as  open ,  len , etc, and will throw an exception in such cases:
TypeError: <built-in function open> is not a Python function
The below function (inspired by  this answer ) demonstrates a workaround. It returns the number of args expected by  f :
from inspect import isfunction, getargspec
def num_args(f):
if isfunction(f):
return len(getargspec(f).args)
else:
spec = f.__doc__.split('\n')[0]
args = spec[spec.find('(')+1:spec.find(')')]
return args.count(',')+1 if args else 0
The idea is to parse the function spec out of the  __doc__  string. Obviously this relies on the format of said string so is hardly robust!
