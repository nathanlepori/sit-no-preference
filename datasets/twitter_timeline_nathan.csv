@CrashSSB I perfectly agree with everything you said. And I'm seeing a lot of improvement in my playstyle already. Low and mid level players overlook this aspect of improving and I made the same mistake myself not even that much time ago,2019-09-20 05:33:54,en,False
@1PEW1 For combos I guess you don't get that many true follow-ups because of floatiness but you can still get very good juggles. So not the worst MU but IMO at most even,2019-09-14 08:44:35,en,False
@1PEW1 Not always. From my experience ness' bair either trades or wins with Roy's fair at effective range. And if you play the spacing game you don't get that much out of it. You have to get more run-up jab but it can be baited into grab for a lot of damage and kills by ness,2019-09-14 08:42:48,en,False
