@MVG_Mew2King No.
@Phoeternally @AcidaceZero THIS DEFINITLY AINT IT
@AcidaceZero ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
Done with palu nonsense today. Video will come out soon

Palu is broken and don‚Äôt believe what the palu players say about her, don‚Äôt even indulge in that. If they‚Äôd actually all band together and explore the character thoroughly (like the bayos use to do) you‚Äôd see true toxicity.
@Dark_Wizzy_ That‚Äôs not gonna get nothing nerfed üôÑ
Works on mario.

You have to do delayed nair &gt; pull back and fast fall before the last hit &gt; dash nair and repeat again the first step. If done wrong he can upb out / double jump (gets hit anyway if he double jumps though)

@Dark_Wizzy_ can it go yet??
@galaxiessb Probably a little of everything, weight, size, hurtbox shifting, etc.
@Dark_Wizzy_ No dasani
@Dark_Wizzy_ But I can finish it with uair / bair and they‚Äôll die........
@Dark_Wizzy_ If this works how it‚Äôs suppose to then don‚Äôt bother me when I‚Äôm nair looping two people at the same time okay thanks üòå
@Dark_Wizzy_ This move gots to go.
@MVG_Mew2King It‚Äôs omega toxic on bowser and I‚Äôm pretty sure you could do it for free yourself too on bowser in less than an hour.
@Jabes_SSB @Panda_Bair Already tested it and it works on other characters. Instead of just hitting reply and tweet like you I actually play the game and test and research things while using common sense by the way. Now who are you again who thinks he knows anything?
You can nair loop on megaman, though a bit oddly hard due to his hurt box shifting, you have to do slight left right movements and delayed nair and then instant sh rising nair and ff before the last hit comes out, then repeat the last part continuously.
Learned from using the platform on bayonetta that palu‚Äôs nair loops REALLLLLLLY(?) don‚Äôt work on her, however you can do single hit nair (has true knockback and sends them directly up) and combo from that anyway. It‚Äôs suspicious though because it may be used in other ways to loop
‚ÄúWill you make a video about it?‚Äù-everyone at Paloops

Yes, but notice how people are quick to say things don‚Äôt work instead of actually testing? also that palu player I RT‚Äôd is nice. However what‚Äôs funny is I got this idea from doubles yesterday and then that video showed up.
@BlankSmash Nope. People don‚Äôt wanna do any studying and just autopilot and hide and lie about characters all day.
This probably would be easier to do as well leading into a combo (realistically and optimally) to make work easier since nair to nair loop has better positioning and timing due to how fluid it just feels. But this also probably has to do with olimar‚Äôs body being odd.
Nair loop works on Olimar. But it has a confusing rhythm because you have to wait slightly before Palutena descends from a sh to get the nair to loop properly, then the follow up can proceed as normal with a delayed sh nair.
Also to everyone saying to just SDI her nair‚Äî

it has a 0.3x sdi multiplier and also has 0.5x hitlag multiplier according to kurogane hammer.

Just about non existent SDI unless you literally destroy your controller, but considering how SDI works in this game... GOOD LUCK.
On characters that the loop doesn‚Äôt work on you can instead have this lead into another nair anyway as a combo ender by doing instant full hop rising nair, at higher %‚Äôs it‚Äôs recommended to do bair instead but depending on your movement on nair you may mess up the kill confirm.
@MreSSB PEOPLE BE MAD FAKE AND STAY HIDING LIKE HUH??? Nah, I‚Äôll expose the characters nonsense myself then.
You can‚Äôt nair the same for every character and sometimes a fast fall is required. Sometimes it‚Äôs instant rising sh nair and other times it‚Äôs delayed nair, ff‚Äôing is usually required for instant.
Works on banjo too. The rhythm for it is odd though and requires slight left to right movement to make it work. Btw, you can rar nair all these things too but the timing is more strict.
This can work on other characters as well but I haven‚Äôt fully tested it, though obviously on heavies this is stupid but I‚Äôm trying to see how bad it can get with this. Looks like you can 0-death with repetitive practice though.
@Vayseth_ LOL, it‚Äôs not like that!

!,kryfyetys&amp;5:&amp;6/425:jdhegsir
Since people think they‚Äôre funny I confirmed that the Palutena platform assisted nair loop works on bowser as well, tested with airdodge and jump. Requires a delayed jump nair, with practice it‚Äôs not hard at all and is similar to joker uair loops.
@LudwigAhgren @PG_ESAM i lost to @noel_puppy in mario party button mashing minigame last year LOL idk how ppl do it
@toph_bbq LOL ur so stupid

@TKONoir it increases both our happiness towards a greater collective good
@Mkleosb Np lol
As i philosophize life more i think the best conclusion is to be happy and to try to do a greater collective good than bad
@9lives_Salem Like Salem's comment if you support his cause
@9lives_Salem Ok the likes of this comment can be for No
Do i troll dark wizzy while he's here till Thursday
@JetG_10 @Mkleosb BURN THAT
Congrats @Mkleosb
leo's just the best player by far imo. Last summit just destroyed everyone with lucina, now same with joker. Marth isnt very good but can we talk about INCINEROAR make him exist pls
@Baenessa0 winry?
@9lives_Salem :(
@GlutonnySSB Congrats!
@TweekSsb The best are usually when just thinking "what is my opponent doing and how can i destroy them better/harder?" (Summit6 was with this mindset as 1 example)
@TweekSsb This might also sound empty (it's not) but focusing on strengths/habits/positive parts of things instead of distractions is the best. My worst sets have been when i tell myself bad things and/or unnecessarily distraction thoughts.
@TweekSsb Ik it might/could sound empty but imo trust me on that part at the minimum as i speak from personal experience of very similar types of situations often (and a very emotionally inconsistent life with heavy depression that goes on and off the entire 2nd half of my life)
@TweekSsb the single most important thing to keep in mind imo is that ur peak is good enough to beat anyone. That's what i keep in mind myself btw which is why i randomly have very good sets/moments/comebacks/etc amidst the inconsistencies throughout my life
@Samsora_ @TweekSsb I dont mean it in a bad way btw, i just think it was extremely impressive set on tweek's end is all. Everyone already knows his peak is insane. Tweek reminds me of myself a lot tbh in terms of the fluctuation range of possibilities
@TweekSsb https://t.co/H5gm57tcYJ

This was pretty godly idk
