@CharlieYang Yes
@DabuzSenpai YOU VOTED LIKE 3 TIMES BEFORE THAT LOL
@Blakebeats @DabuzSenpai I didn't dabuz is just bad and mad :))
@DabuzSenpai U threw Shutup lmaO
Where is hot bid when you need him
Cheating and teammates sucking aside I think the rules were insanely in favor of town because of infinite nominations. A ruling so bad Slime only let it rock one day but it still was enough to kill D1 lmao
@Light_S21 KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN ZOOMER
Nah it worked out perfectly, take out someone who is good and knows how I play as Mafia, and draw enough suspicion on me for a vote but not enough for me to die so I'm soft confirmed town. No regrets https://t.co/ImiLCbzMVP
No way town is winning like 98% of the games when theyre this bad, someone is def cheating
Light is a cheater like 99% sure lmao
Also D1 and dabuz are actual throwers.
D1 did the worse defence of all time and somehow thought Slep wasn't cop, and dabuz was completely silent (unlike himself) and was the vote that killed D1.......
@AbatWolf @NiPnDiP2 Kk has a ton of cheese he just has no sauce
@NiPnDiP2 Rofl no toxic is not when they have a slight amount of cheese. Even bottom tier in this have a whole ass cheese platter ready
AF*
still like the game overall, just not in a double elim bracket format :)
Also now that I've beaten a top player can I just state
Ult is still a shitty competitive game LMAO fuck 76 characters with 66 being toxic ar
Live from summit! Talking my bracket run, being the pokemon master and more!

Keep fighting https://t.co/qTqwgBXn5W
@yo05467926 Same right haha
@ramongosling I typed the first part really early!!!
I wanna pay attention to the rest of the tournament, but I really just wanna grind! I'm pretty bummerino + I had a lackluster season if you look at results, but I've gotten a lot of results outside of the game that I'm really proud of :) Apologies *if* no couch void/mafia
I got fucked LMAO A lot of my moves weren't trading, which was pretty unfortunate but no biggie ^^ 13th at Summit, and I think I'll only be going to kongo saga for the rest of the season? Gonna be practicing for til then unless people want me at DHATL
Vs esam 
https://t.co/jDSUdwxg3D
Genuinely couldnt bring myself to finish the vod LOL
Only just now watched IG vs GRF and ??????
HE MASHED 105 IN 5 SECONDS AFTER  WE BOTH CAPPED 160 THE FIRST TIME

21 MASH PER SECOND WTF
Aight @LudwigAhgren smacked me so hard in mashing that it wasn't even close

He's literally a god wtf, I'm sorry for doubting you

Sub to him on twitch
Dabuz putting the fear in everyone completely shifted the game in his favor
100% @BearUNLV got a lot better this summit for mafia, although he does always get power roles, lucky jerk LOL
Damn @TSM_Leffen manipulated everyone to think I played bad when I literally didn't LOL post-saying that everyone thought d1 was Mafia when he wasn't (and half the room didn't vote)

That was good stuff
With the second Smash Ultimate Summit in the books, @echofoxgg's &amp; @mvgleague's MKLeo made a run through losers to take it from @eUnited's Samsora in Grand Finals 3-0 after a reset!

The #PGRU is slated to end later this year and with a new Top 10 in the works, who's your pick? https://t.co/XWpPjn9iWR
@MightyKeef @ThePhenomenalEE You learn
Leo is absolutely absurd
I have never been more carried in my entire life https://t.co/JR77fDZw9j
Peach is better than PALU
@ThePhenomenalEE No but you need to take some photos and review sometimes
